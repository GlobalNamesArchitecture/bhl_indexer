the eye-spots. Between and surrounding the visual cells are 
 numerous bipolar, elongate supportive cells which stain strongly 
 with connective tissue stains. In some cases the eye areas are 
 not in the form of follicles as Pfeifer, 1901, has shown in a species 
 of Astropectcn. In those eye areas which appear as follicles a 
 lens has been described and figured by Pfeffer and others but I am 
 inclined to the interpretation of Cuenot, 1887, who believed that 
 no lens is present. In fact, in some sections which I have seen 
 there was no sign of even a membrane over the mouth of the 
 follicles. 

In the superficial system many long supportive cells help to 
 make up the bulk of the nerve cord. These stain deeply with 
 usual stains and at their inner ends are more or less intertwined. 

Fig. 27. A. Diagram of a Starfish cut so as to expose internal as well as 
 external parts of the nervous system. In the center the deep nerve 
 ring is shown by a dark cui'ved line, the surface nerve ring by 
 a thicker line. These parts are continued into the arm cut longi- 
 tudinally on the right. Nerves to the tube-feet are shown. The 
 superficial nerve plexus and internal nerves are indicated. B. 
 Cross section of the radial nerve of starfish, superficial and deep 
 parts shown. C. Nerve cells and supportive cells from the central 
 nervous system. D. Section through one of the pedicellariae of sea- 
 urchin showing distribution of nerves, after Ilamann. E. Section 
 through "taste knob" of sea-urchin. Hamann.
