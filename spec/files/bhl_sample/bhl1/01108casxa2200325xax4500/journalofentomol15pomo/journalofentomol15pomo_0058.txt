after subsidiance in such a state that they react more readily to 
 stimuli in a distant part of the body than the rosettes near the new 
 stimulus ; 6, There are differences in the characteristics of indi- 
 viduals. 

The opening of the pedicellariae depends upon : 

1. Homogeneous preparatory stimuli 

(a) Sometimes there is no response to the first stimulus. 

(b) Sometimes the first stimulus causes retraction and 
 closing while later ones cause extension and opening. 

(c) Sometimes with large pedicellariae the first stimulus 
 causes momentary opening, the next two or three have no visible 
 effect, the next pronounced opening. 

2. Chemical stimuli of a certain character cause the pedi- 
 cellariae to open later and more readily under mechanical stimuli. 

3. Chemical stimuli of a certain character cause later refusal 
 to open under usual mechanical stimulation, 

4. Holding some object causes the pedicellariae after release 
 to refuse to open under other stimuli. 

5. After closing the pedicellariae often open and close again 
 spontaneously, "snapping." The foregoing action furnishes the 
 condition for the succeeding one. 

In many cases the tube-feet are compelled to do much feeling 
 about before they find the object seized by the pedicellariae. In 
 exploring movements two or three rays are raised from the others 
 and swung about in the water; the other rays creep about. The 
 tip of the arm as well as the other parts of the arm are employed 
 in these feeling motions. 

The relative intensity of illumination on different parts of the 
 body of the starfish may and at times does determine the direction 
 of movement without regard to the direction of the rays of light. 
 The ventral portion of the surface of the starfish is protected by
