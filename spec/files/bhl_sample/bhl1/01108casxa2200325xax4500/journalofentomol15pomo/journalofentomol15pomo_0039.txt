June 19. Lighter, the spots more faded than when in the con- 
 trol. The difference between the two not so marked as on June 18, 

June 20. SHghtly lighter, more yellowish in tone. Results 
 not so distinct. 

VIII. b. June 21. Two frogs with reddish streak (June 20). 
 The streak more yellowish, now has a distinctly yellowish tone. 
 Spots lighter. Whole tone more yellow than control. 

Reversed the frogs. 

June 22. Yellowish in tone. Red streak now very yellowish. 
 Spots lighter. 

IX. June 17. 5 P. M. Two frogs, dark in color, with red 
 streaks down the back. One in blue covered jar, one control. 

June 18. 10 A. M. Frog much lighter than the control. 

The red streak along the back now sandy colored, however, 
 still with the reddish tint. Control color unchanged. Noticeably 
 darker than the one in blue. 

The frogs reversed. 

June 19. Lighter, the red streak sandy colored, same width as 
 before. Sides light grayish green. Whole tone lighter than the 
 one in the control. 

The frogs reversed. 

June 20. Lighter in tone, more greenish tinge. The red 
 streak now sandy, slightly greenish also. 

I observed some pigment cells under the microscopes. The 
 melanophores (black) were the most noticeable, although on close 
 observation yellow and bluish grey pigment cells could be seen. 

I stimulated the piece of skin with ice ; in some cases the black 
 cells seemed to expand and in others this could not be seen. Some 
 such action, however, would be necessary to cause the darkening in 
 color brought about by cold. 

The stimulations with heat were somewhat less definite than 
 with cold ; however twice the contraction of the melanophores, due 
 to a heat stimulus, was observed. 

Left the two dead frogs for six hours. When I observed them 
 again they were both remarkably lighter than they had been when 
 they were killed. 

I took a bit of their skin and observed it again. One portion 
 was much lighter and had several isolated melanophores. I cooled 
 this piece of skin with ice, then stimulated it with hot water. The 
 pigment cells seemed to expand. 

Conclusions : 

1. The tree frog changes its color in response to heat, cold 
 and changes in the color of its environment.
