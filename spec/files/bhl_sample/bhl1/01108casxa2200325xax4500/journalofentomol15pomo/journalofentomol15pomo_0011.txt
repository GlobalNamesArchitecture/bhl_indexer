Two models were made by the blotting paper method. In one 

of these the outer portion of the epithelium was taken as the outer 

limit and the lining of the cavity as the other. The other model 

was built from the plates which were cut from the interior of the 

Upper figure model of the cavity, from outside. 
 Lower figure model of epithelium from outside. 

Both figures X40.
