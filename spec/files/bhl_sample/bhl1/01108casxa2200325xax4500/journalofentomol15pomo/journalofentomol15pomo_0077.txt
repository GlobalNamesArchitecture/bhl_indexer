HOLOTHUROIDEA 

In sea-cucumbers the chief parts of the nervous system are 
 much as in other groups but the superficial and deep radial and 
 circum-oral systems are quite distinct from each other. 

The more superficial system is composed of five strands in 
 an epineural cavity under the longitudinal radial muscles but well 
 in from the surface of the body. The oral ring circles the peris- 
 tome; at the base of the tentacles between its radial branches 
 there are strands, one for each tentacle ; other branches go to the 
 pharynx and intestinal tract. The epineural cavity seems not 
 present in some forms, possibly due to contraction of the animal. 
 The radial nerves end at the anal end of the body but there is no 
 special terminal tentacle. The radial nerves give oif branches 
 to the tube-feet and also to the skin ; two nerve plexuses have been 
 recognized, a superficial just under the epithelium and a deeper 
 one in the body-wall. Both of these networks receive some 
 branches from the radial nerve. 

The deeper nerve ring or hyponeural divides into two strands 
 on the inside of each superficial radial nerve according to Hero- 
 uard, '87. This deeper system is chiefly motor while the super- 
 ficial system is sensory, a generalization which he extends to other 
 echinoderms. Branches from the deep system are said to supply 
 muscles of the body-wall and lantern region. 

Among the earlier works dealing with the nervous system of 
 holothurians was that of Krohn, 1841, where the radial nerves 
 were noticed but little detail given. Semon, 1883, and especially 
 Hamann, show the general form and histological structure of the 
 nervous system. Herouard, '87-'89, brings out some points, espe- 
 cially emphasizing the motor and sensory divisions of the nervous 
 system, as already noted. 

Gerould, '96, shows the nervous system in Caudina but little 
 is said about it. Clark in Synapta, 1898, shows the nervous system 
 in section. Red spots at the bases of the tentacles, the so-called 
 eyes, are figured. 

Five radial nerves are recognized and smaller branches to the 
 tentacles. Each radial nerve is divided longitudinally into an 
 outer and inner band as in other forms, but unlike others has no 
 vessel of any kind accompanying the nerves and no spaces or 
 lacunae. Each tentacle nerve sends off branches to the digits so 
 that almost the whole surface of the tentacle becomes sensory. On 
 the bases of the tentacles and in the ectoderm over the body are 
 sense buds or tactile papillae such as described by Hamann, '83. 
 Under each of these is a small ganglion. From the lower side of 
 the circum-oral ring, between every two tentacles, a broad nerve
