cells reaching from the surface to the depths of the nervous system 
 and also probably bipolar sense cells as well as more or less deeply 
 placed multipolar nerve cells giving off fibers to the nerve areas. 

The epidermis is a general organ of sense, the exact nature of 
 which has not been very clearly determined. Spengel considers 
 that about the proboscis in its ventral face there are points espe- 
 cially sensitive. In fact at this place he describes a deep depression 
 which he regarded as a special sense organ. 

In the larval stage the first suggestion of a nervous system we 
 find in the development of the apical plate which in later stages 
 develops eye spots as simple caps of ectodermal cells surrounded by 
 pigment. The eye spots become anterior in position with a pocket 
 of the clear cells each ending in a point. Between the two eye- 
 cups a mass of pigment develops. At the base of the apical plate 
 nerve fibers begin to be seen. 

At metamorphosis in a region where the collar will develop a 
 transverse groove forms near the mid-dorsal line. In the mid- 
 dorsal region a strip of ectoderm not crossed by grooves makes the 
 beginning of the neural plate. It sinks beneath the surface and 
 folds of the adjacent ectoderm or neural folds meet over it, and in 
 this way the neural tube is formed.
