Notes on the Early Stages of the Syrphid 
 Genus Microdon (Diptera) 

By Frank R. Cole, Stanford University 

The peculiar larvae of the Syrphid flies of the genus Microdon 
 have been described by several entomologists, but they are known 
 in only a few species. Enthusiasts in past years placed these 
 bizarre forms among the molluscs in two or three instances, and 
 one entomologist stated that they were the early stages of a Coccid 
 on oaks. Wheeler has given a very interesting account of some 
 of these early stages and the habits of the flies. In America the 
 larvae are recorded only from ants nests, but Wasmann states that 
 they may be found in the nests of certain wasps and termites. 
 They live in nests in the soil, under rocks or under the bark of 
 old logs. 

The larvae creep very slowly, with a wave-like motion of the 
 flat ventral sole, which is fringed and applied closely to the sur- 
 face over which they are travelling. Their food is probably, as 
 Wheeler believes, the minute pellets of food ejected from the 
 hypopharyngeal pockets of worker ants after the moisture has been 
 extracted. There is evidently one brood in a year, the flies emerg- 
 ing in May and June. 

In May, 1917, the writer found a number of pupae of Micro- 
 don cothurnatus Bigot, while collecting in the Hood River Valley 
 of Oregon. The type of this species came from "Mt. Hood," prob- 
 ably somewhere in the valley north of the mountain. While pull- 
 ing off the bark from an old pine log an ant's nest was uncovered, 
 and among the frenzied inhabitants of the nest a number of 
 Microdoyi pupae were noticed. The ant was later determined as a 
 subspecies of Camponotus maculatus. At this date. May 19, there 
 were no larvae of the fly present and the pupae were all fully 
 developed. Eighteen pupae were taken, most of them rather closely 
 crowded near the entrance to the nest ; all around them were empty 
 puparia, bearing evidence that the nest had been used for several 
 seasons by the flies. There were several adult flies around the log, 
 some of them freshly emerged, but the ants were so aroused at the 
 disturbing of their domestic tranquility that they quickly drove out 
 any strange insect that came near. The puparia taken were allowed 
 to become too dry and only two adults emerged out of the lot. 

In April, 1921, some observations were made on another 
 species of Microdon. A student at Stanford University, Mr. Her- 
 bert Mason, found a single larva in a nest of Camponotus maculatus 
 vicinus Mayr. This specimen was reared by Mr. Carl Duncan and 
 the specimen and notes regarding it kindly turned over to the 
 writer. The species proved to be Microdon piperi Knab, a beautiful 
 dark blue species which ranges north along the Pacific coast region. 

The larva was not closely examined by the writer, but in the 
 notes made on the specimien the color was given as largely pale
