epigynum and thus not visible from below, the end not appear- 
 ing notched at middle ; dorsal strip ending considerably proxi- 
 mad of end of epigynum. 

b. Opening with no tooth or process from each lateral margin, 
 not thus partially subdivided; spermathecae essentially 

longitudinal; dorsal strip broader (Fig. 10)

b/ Opening partly divided into a distal and proximal portion 
 by lateral processes ; caudal portion of spermathecae bent 
 at right angles, a distinct enlarged anterior and porterior 
 portion being connected by a narrower isthmus ; dorsal 
 strip narrower. 

c. Lateral margins of epigynum not indented ; isthmus of 
 of spermathecae narrower, curved, concave ectally.

 caudal ends of spermathecae ; isthmus of spermathecae

In the male of this species the ectal margin of the cymbium of 
 the palpus bears two conspicuous black spines proximad of the 
 ' apical curved one as in puritanus; but in the present species the 
 more proximal of these spines is in the re-entrant angle above 
 basal lobe or auricle, whereas it is distinctly distad of this position 
 in puritanus. A readily noted difference in the bulb is that the 
 larger lobe at apex of bulb is entire in hesperus, with no separate 
 process from inner distal corner as in the eastern form ; and be- 
 tween this lobe and the conductor there are two folds of conical out- 
 line not present in the latter species (Cf. fig 2). The female 
 differs conspicuously in not having the epigynal opening ter- 
 minal and thus producing a median notch when viewed from below. 
 The epigynum in its structure most resembles that of interfector, 
 but differs in outline and in the form of the spermathecae (Cf. 
 figs. 7 and 8).
