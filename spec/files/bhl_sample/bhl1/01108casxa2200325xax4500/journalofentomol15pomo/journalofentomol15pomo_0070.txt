secrete the sac about themselves. The eggs are layed in the 
 bottom of the sac, being quite closely packed with wax filaments. 
 As the female deposits the eggs her body is crowded forward, the 
 dead remains being found in the upper end of the sac. In some 
 instances in the laboratory, it was noted that undersized females 
 would secrete a sac, deposit a small number of eggs and die. Upon 
 dissection, it was found that there were often mature eggs in the 
 oviducts or partly developed eggs in the ovaries. The first laid 
 eggs in the bottom of the sac hatched several days in advance of 
 the others and thus the nymphs escaped before the later eggs 
 hatched. 

Under laboratory conditions the first moult took place 17 days 
 after hatching and the second moult a week later. After the sec- 
 ond moult the individuals had lost the pale cadium yellow color and 
 became the violet gray of the adult. The day following the second 
 moult they secreted sacs, although they were very much smaller 
 than those which first made sacs under natural conditions. Nor- 
 mally they probably have five moults. The overwintering indi- 
 viduals found in nature were first instar nymphs which had not 
 left the sac. 

Parasites. — One Hymenopterous insect was found, Pseudo- 
 coccobius claiisseni Timberlake (2) which parasitized a large per- 
 centage of the mealy-bugs. As many as six of these parasites 
 were found in an adult female. They usually kill the female after 
 she has made the sac and before oviposition. They overwinter in 
 the sac as adults, emerging in the spring through circular holes 
 which they make. 

Resistance to droivning. — Several experiments were made to 
 see if this insect was specially protected from the water. It was 
 found that submergence for three or four days had no ill effect on 
 an adult and that they could float on the surface of fresh water for 
 three weeks without dying. These results are of little significance, 
 however, as Mr. Floyd Wymore, in his B. S. thesis work at the 
 University of California, 1922, found that Pseudococcus gahani 
 Green, a terrestrial mealy-bug, not only could live under water but 
 laid eggs and otherwise lead quite a normal life. 

Acknowledgements. — I am deeply indebted to Prof. G. F. Fer- 
 ris of Stanford University for numerous courtesies, especially for 
 determining this mealy-bug as a new species and for the permis- 
 sion to examine his collection of Coccidae. I am also indebted to 
 Mr. W. C. Matthews for photographing figure B, and to Prof. E. O. 
 Essig for suggestions and aid. 

Note: (2) Mr. A. B. Gahan, Entomological Assistant of the United States 
 National Museum, writes as follows: "The parasite appears to be Pseudo- 
 coccobius cla7(fiftevi Timberlake. This species was described from a single 
 male specimen bred from Erhtm sp. [Lichtensioides Ckle.] * * * at Riverside, 
 Calif. Your males differ very slightly in the extent of yellowish color on 
 the face but I believe there is very little reason to doubt that they represent 
 this species with the type of which they have been compared."
