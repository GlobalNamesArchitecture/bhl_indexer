The North American Species of Mimetus 

By Ralph V. Chamberlin 

In his "Araneides of the United States," Hentz describes three 
 species under the genus Mimetus ; namely, interf ector , tuberosus 
 and syllepsicus. Of these three syUepsicus has not since been defi-. 
 nitely identified, while tuberosus is generally regarded as a synonym 
 of interf ector, a disposition with which no fault can be found. In 
 1882 Emerton described a male from Connecticut under the name 
 M. epeiroides: but the practice in recent years has been to refer all 
 individuals of the genus found in the United States to one species, 
 interf ector, and, accordingly, in current catalogues epeiroides has 
 been placed in synonymy with that species. 

However, a careful study of ample material of Mimetus from 
 various parts of the country reveals that there are at least five 
 clearly distinct species that have been confused under the name 
 interf ector. One species occurs on the Pacific Coast apparently 
 from Washington to southern California and eastward to Texas, 
 Two species occur in the Northeastern States, the commoner of 
 these ranging southward as far as northern Georgia. The other 
 two species are common in the Southern States ; and one of them is 
 found as far northward as Long Island, N. Y. It seems reasonably 
 certain that it was one of these two southern forms that was de- 
 scribed by Hentz as interf ector, the particular one being fixed, it is 
 believed, by the figure of the palpus as indicated later in the notes 
 on the species. Tuberosus is left as a synonym of interf ector; but 
 syllepsicus cannot be placed at present and is apparently different 
 from any of the five species here listed. 

The males of these five species are easily recognized by the 
 characters presented in the palpus, the armature of the ectal mar- 
 gin of the cymbium providing a convenient index. Another readily 
 observed character of diagnostic importance occurs in the ter- 
 minal portion of the bulb which in the retracted organ lies adjacent 
 to the base of the embolus and presents typically two flat or lamellar 
 lobes projecting proximad. In one species (notius) one of these 
 lamellar lobes is aborted and in another (puritanus) the second lobe 
 is itself partly divided or bilobed. 

The four species of which females are known may be sepa- 
 rated in that sex by the characters of the epigynum, which is in the 
 form of a strongly chitinized, transversely furrowed, caudally pro- 
 jecting lobe. At the caudal end of the epigynum, or near it on 
 its dorsal side, is an opening or pit and cephalad or proximad of 
 this on the dorsal side is a separately chitinized median longitudinal 
 piece or strip. The position and form of this epigynal opening or 
 pit, the size and position of caudal end of the median dorsal strip,
