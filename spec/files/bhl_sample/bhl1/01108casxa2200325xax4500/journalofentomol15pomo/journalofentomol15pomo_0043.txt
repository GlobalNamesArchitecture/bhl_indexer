 California. No. 1

Two days during the second week of April 1922 were spent 
 collecting Lepidoptera at Corn Spring, Chuckawalla mountains, 
 Riverside county, California. The Chuckawallas are typical Colo- 
 rado desert mountains, being low and rough, and having the vege- 
 tation for the most part confined to sandy washes. Corn Spring 
 lies on the north side of the range in a canyon of the same name. 
 It is a small palm covered oasis having many introduced plants 
 as it is the home of an old prospector, who has a house and garden 
 at the spring. The elevation is approximately 1500 feet. 

Fourteen species of butterflies were collected and three ob- 
 served. The nomenclature used is that of Barnes and McDun- 
 nough's Check List. 

1. Pieris protodice, form vernalis — Edw. Three males and 
 two females taken. Fairly common around spring. 

2. Nathalis iole — Bdv. Five males collected. Found spar- 
 ingly flying over bare, windswept desert mosaic. One specimen 
 taken near mouth of Corn Spring canyon far from any vegetation. 

3. Eurymus eurytheme, form keewaydin — Edw. Two males 
 and two females taken. Common near spring. 

4. Danais archippus — Fabr. One specimen seen at spring. 

5. Danais berenice — var. strigosa — Bates. One specimen 
 seen with the above flying among the palms at Corn Spring. 

6. Melitaea Neumoegeni — Skin — Wright. Fourteen males 
 and five females of this interesting species were taken. Probably 
 the most common butterfly of that locality. 

7. Chlosyne californica — Wright. Nine males and five fe- 
 males taken in a small canyon about two miles above the spring. 
 These butterflies seemed to be very local in their distribution, one 
 small canyon being the only place that they were found. Types 
 figured by Wright from specimens taken in Colorado Desert, South- 
 eastern California. The Chuckawallas are at the northern edge 
 of the type locality.
