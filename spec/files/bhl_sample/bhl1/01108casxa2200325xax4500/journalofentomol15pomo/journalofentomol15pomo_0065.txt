Fig. 31. Nervous system of Secpent-Stars. A. Diagram of the nervous 
 system of a serpent-star, a part of the disc and the bases of three 
 rays shown. In the upper right end ray the superficial nerve ring 
 and radial nerve are removed to show the deeper nerves. In the 
 others and on the disc other nerves are shown. On the disc the 
 superficial nerve-net is given. Out from the radial and circum-oral 
 nerve the chief branches to the tube feet, etc., are shown. B. Dia- 
 gram of the nervous system of one of the arms cut across showing 
 large cavity of an arm in deep shading and the lowest cavity 
 within radial nerve, with branches to spines and tube-feet. C. 
 Diagram of section of an arm after Hamann. D. Through the arm 
 at another level. E. Section through radial nerve. Hamann. F. 
 Section through sense papilla. Hamann.
