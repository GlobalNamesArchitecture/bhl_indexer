The pedicellariae of sea-urchins refuse to seize or hold each 
 other or parts of the bodies or others of the same species. Von 
 Uexkull believes this is due to a presence of a substance "auto- 
 dermin" which is in the skin. In sea-urchin pericellariae have the 
 power of independent reactions. Each when isolated on a piece of 
 shell may behave as when on the body of the animal. The stimulus 
 from the pedicellariae need not pass through the radial nerves for 
 if the nerve is cut the reactions are as before.

The nervous system of serpent-stars is more complicated than 
 that of starfish. The radial and circum-oral nerves are shut off 
 from the surface of the body and inclosed in a small cavity. The 
 more superficial radial and circum-oral nerves are well developed 
 and from the radial nerves fibers run out to the spines of the legs 
 and the tube^feet. These last are provided with ganglia at their 
 bases and with nerve strands running their length. The nerves 
 which run to the spines also have ganglionic thickenings upon 
 them at the bases of the spines. From the ganglia at the bases of 
 the tube-feet delicate strands run out to one epineural ganglion 
 for each tube-foot. On the ventral side of the disc on each side of 
 radial nerves lateral nerves run out to near the margin of the disc 
 communicating with the radial nerves and also connected with the 
 superficial nerve plexus on the lower side of the disc. There are 
 then in this way two lateral nerves from each arm base, and each 
 one of these sends out an inter-radial nerve. Nerves from the 
 circum-oral ring run to the teeth, five pairs in all. 

The deeper radial and circum-oral nerves are closely applied 
 to the more superficial nerves and appear much like parts of them, 
 being represented by groups of dorsally placed cells. These deeper 
 nerves are two for each arm. The circum-oral ring about the 
 mouth sends out pairs of nerves to the muscles of the arm. 

A system of so-called genital nerves is found quite distinct 
 and independent from the other systems. More or less isolated 
 loops of fibers are found in each area of the disc between the arms. 

Hamann, 1888. gives one of the best accounts of the nervous' 
 system. Delage and Herouard also figure and describe the nerv- 
 ous system in this group. The first author describes and figures 
 nerves coming out laterally from the chief radial nerve to be 
 applied to the skin. These may be the cutaneous nerves of Delage 
 and Herouard. 

Hamann also shows strands from these to the tube-feet where 
 ganglia are located and from these ganglia are nerves with ganglia 
 running in to the center of the arm, and also nerves arching up 
 dorsally to end in small ganglia. These are very much in the posi- 
 tion as shown in the diagrams and figures.
