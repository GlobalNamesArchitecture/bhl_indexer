May, 1917, Log removed to Alhambra, California. 

July and August, 1917, 5 adults emerged from log. 

April, 1918, 4 full-grown and 5 partly-grown larvae observed 
 in one piece of log. 

August and September, 1918, 4 adults emerged from re- 
 mainder of log. 

July and August, 1919, 3 adults emerged. 

April 1, 1920, one nearly full-grown larva found in log. 

July 12, 1920, larva pupated. 

August 8, 1920, adult formed. 

August 23, 1920, adult emerged from log. 

The partly-grown larvae observed by Mr. Martin in 1916 must 
 have been the ones to emerge in 1917 and 1918, indicating the life 
 cycle to be at least 2 or 3 years. However, they may have been 
 more than one year old in 1916. Mr. Martin believes that the 
 small larvae observed in 1917 were from a brood deposited after 
 the log was' discovered in May, 1916. However, it is apparent that 
 there was no deposition after the logs were taken in May, 1917, 
 and it seems probable that the latest deposition possible was from 
 beetles which emerged in the summer of 1916. If this is true, 
 then the life cycle of the beetle emerging in 1920 was practically 
 4 years. It is possible that deposition occurred prior to 1916, 
 which would make the life cycle 5 years or more. Beetles emerg- 
 ing in the other years must have been from 1 to 3 years old at the 
 time the log was discovered. If this is so, it would make 4 sep- 
 arate broods, which seems improbable. It is the writer's opinion 
 that there probably were two broods, and that the life cycle of 
 Dinapate wrigMii may vary from 3 to 5 years. It is certain that 
 the period can be four years. The quantity and quality of food 
 accessible to each individual larva no doubt had much to do with 
 the rate of development, but probably other factors enter in also. 
 If the log contained only one brood, then the variation in the length 
 of life would be still greater. 

It is interesting to note that when Mr. H. G. Hubbard visited 
 Palm Canyon in February, 1897, he observed that "all larvae were 
 thoroughly dormant and very flaccid. There are no young, and 
 evidently all are of the same age and nearly or quite adult. I 
 feel sure that they are more than one year old, and probably more 
 than 2 years old, but no doubt they would have issued in July or 
 August of this year."- 

Specimens sent to Washington by Mr. Hubbard did emerge 
 in August. His belief that the life cycle would be at least 3 years 
 is demonstrated by the writer's experience.
