Notes on California Bombyliidae with 
 Descriptions of New Species 

Frank R. Cole, Stanford University, Cal. 

The sun-loving Bombyliidae have always been a favorite group 
 with the writer, as the rather abraded specimens in his earliest 
 collections will bear evidence. California is rich in species of these 
 flies and notes on a few of the interesting forms are given below. 

During the past two summers the writer has spent some time 
 in Mill Creek Canyon in San Bernardino County. Paracosmus 
 morrisoni O. S. is a very common form in this locality and is 
 usually taken aloni? roads and paths in the bright sunlight, Aphoe- 
 bantus vittatus Coq., a trim, beautifully marked little species, 
 occurs along with the above, but is not so common and is often 
 harder to catch. Villa squamigera Coq. and Villa mira Coq. are 
 not uncommon in the Mill Creek region, the latter species more 
 abundant in August, when it is found out in the sandy river 
 washes. Villa miscella Coq. is seldom seen and is quite wary, 
 flying up and down sandy roads for long distances when disturbed. 
 In Glen Martin, in this same general region but at a higher alti- 
 tude, one occasionally finds Rhabdoselaphus setosa Cresson, a little 
 species with a very long proboscis : it is usually taken on the wing 
 in the middle of the day, hovering near the ground. With the first 
 days of autumn specimens of Villa autumyialis Cole begin to ap- 
 pear, frequenting the yellow flowers of Ericameria and Chry- 
 sothamnus, and now and then a specimen of the beautiful golden 
 Lordotiis diversus Coq. 

Villa chromolepida new species. 

Female. Length 7 mm. Black, clothed with bright iridescent 
 scales ; front tibiae without bristles ; wings hyaline. 

Head rather large in proportion to the body; proboscis pointed 
 and scarcely projecting beyond the oral margin; palpi small, black, 
 cylindrical and black pilose. Antennae black, first joint about 
 twice as long as second and with black pile; third joint twice as 
 long as first two combined and gradually tapering toward apex 
 (see fig. 9), the apical bristle minute. Frons shining black, with 
 erect black pile and sparse golden scales which are purple in 
 certain lights. Face projecting (see fig. 10), shining black, with 
 scales like frons but denser, pile short, black, reclinate. Cheeks 
 shining black, bare of pile or scales. Occiput black, densely 
 clothed with scales like those on face and frons ; next the hollowed 
 out back of the head a line of short, fine, yellowish pile. 

Mesonotum and scutellum shining black, with golden green 
 scales, purple by reflection ; the median portion of dorsum with
