Some Common Chinese MoUusca

During the last year I had the opportunity to collect and ex- 
 amine a number of the commoner littoral and freshwater shell-bear- 
 ing Mollusca occuring near Canton and at Chung Chow, Hongkong 
 territory. The shells enumerated include only a fair sample of 
 what might be obtained after longer search under more favorable 
 conditions. 

It is interesting to note the alliance of this fauna with that 
 of the islands of the Pacific and with that of the California coast. 
 A number of species occur here that are found on the opposite 
 shore but there is a very complex admixture of the more definitely 
 warm-water forms and with some species of endemic origin. The 
 observations of Ralph Arnold (Palae. San Pedro, Calif., Acad. Sc. 
 03) concerning the tertiary shells of San Pedro and Japan shows 
 us the affinities at once of the living shell-bearing mollusca of 
 these two regions and likewise adds to our observations concerning 
 the relationship between the whole Pacific molluscan complex. 
 The molluscan fauna of South China appears to be paleotropical 
 considered in its broadest aspect. 

All shells were determined by Dr. H. A. Pilsbury of the Phila- 
 delphia Academy. In all there are one hundred and thirty-seven 
 species represented in this collection.
