motor and probably some sensory fibers in these. Sense cells and 
 an epithelial plexus were not clearly seen in this form. Retzius 
 found sense cells in the skin chiefly about the mouth opening, in 
 the tentacles and the tube feet. In this form the peripheral nerve 
 fibers were not found. Crozier, 1915, discusses the sensory reac- 
 tions of Holothuria surinamensis Ludwig. 

The nervous system does not have to be intact for the act of 
 autotomy but it is more successfully carried out when it is unin- 
 jured. 

The animals are reactive to tactile, vibratile, photic, and chem- 
 ical stimuli, and practically indifl'erent to heat in the way of a 
 sensation. 

The parts of the body are sensitive in the following order, 
 beginning with the most sensitive : (1) tentacles, (2) anterior end, 
 (3) posterior end, (4) papillae, (5) pedicels (Podia), (6) mid- 
 body surface. 

The tube-feet discs are positively stereotropic. This shows in 
 the righting reaction. The arms are photokinetic, negatively pho- 
 totropic ; they do not respond to increase in light intensity, but re- 
 spond negatively to decrease in light intensity. The whole surface 
 is sensitive in this way. The fluorescent skin pigment is possibly 
 concerned. 

Dissolved substances representing those homologous to human 
 taste qualities for sour, bitter sweet, salt and alkaline, are effective 
 as stimuli.

There are three distinct parts of the nervous system : 

1. The superficial epidermal. 

2. The deep oral system, according to the suggestions of 
 Delage and Herouard. 

3. The deep aboral system. 

The superficial oral system is much like the radial and circum- 
 oral system of starfish, with the nerve ring and radial nerves run- 
 ning down the surfaces of the ambulacra) grooves in each arm with 
 branches to the surface and to the little elevations covered with 
 sense hairs. 

The deep oral system according to Delage and Herouard's 
 interpretation is in the connective tissue under the epidermis and 
 consists of a central nerve ring and strands down each arm with 
 branches to the pinnacles. 

The deep aboral system develops later than the oral in the 
 young form. It is in the center of the so-called chambered organ. 
 There is a central mass of nervous matter in the chamber ; strands 
 run out from this towards the arms and fork but are united again,
