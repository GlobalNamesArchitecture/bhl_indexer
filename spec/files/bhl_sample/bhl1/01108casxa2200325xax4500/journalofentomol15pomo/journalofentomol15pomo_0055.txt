In the past I have been inclined to consider these as in part at 
 least with conductive function, but I am sure the true nerve cells 
 are sometimes bipolar, possibly in some cases multipolar with 
 fibers running longitudinally and laterally in the nerve strands. 
 The true nervous elements are more delicate, their fibers or fibrils 
 cross each other at various angles but bear no other obvious 
 relations to each other. 

Among the earliest works on the nervous system and sense 
 organs of starfish is that of Haeckel in 1859. In 1860, Wilson has 
 a remarkably clear and accurate paper on the nervous system of 
 the starfish. Another early paper was by Owsiannikow in 1871. 
 Teuscher in 1856, figures the nervous system but not in much detail. 
 Ludwig, 1878, has his figure of the nervous system in section often 
 copied. Hamann, 1883-5, shows more of the structure of the 
 nervous system and gives a good idea of the structure of the eye. 
 Cuenot, 1887, gives a clearer idea of eye structure but not much 
 more about the detail of the nervous system. Jickeli, 1888, recog- 
 nizes four chief parts of the nervous system of starfish: (1) The 
 ambulacral, (2) the sub-epidermal body plexus, (3) the deep 
 nerves, (4) the intestinal nervous system. Pfeffer, 1901, studies 
 the eyes particularly and distinguishes clearly between support- 
 ing cells and nerve cells. More recent papers of Pietschmann, 
 1906, and especially of Meyer, 1906, show details in the nervous 
 system. The last author distinguishes clearly between supportive 
 cells and nerve cells in the nervous system. He finds the suportive 
 cells uni- or bipolar and usually running from the ventral to the 
 dorsal side of the nerve bands. The nerve cells are bipolar or 
 multipolar with fine branches, 

Romanes, 1885, found besides strong negative reactions against 
 injurious stimuli, positive reactions of a chemical nature which 
 he considered due to the sense of smell. This sense depended 
 somewhat on the physiological condition of the animal, chiefly 
 upon its degree of hunger. A starfish, kept several days without 
 food, immediately crawled near some presented. If a small bit of 
 food be withdrawn as the animal approaches, the starfifish could 
 be led about in any direction. By severing various parts of the 
 rays, Romanes found that this so-called olfactory sense was equally 
 distributed throughout the length of the body and by varnishing 
 the upper surface he found that the reactions were unaffected. 
 Also by placing a bit of food on the aboral surface no reaction 
 occurred. Preyer, 1886, found great differences in individuals 
 when stimulated with food. 

Starfish are positively phototropic but largely lose this ten- 
 dency if the eye-spots are removed. Romanes found the sensi- 
 tiveness so great that starfish discriminated between ordinary pine 
 boards covering the tank and the same boards painted black. 
 Romanes Preyer, Jennings and others have studied the righting
