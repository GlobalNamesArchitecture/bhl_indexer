deep and connected; first antennal joint slightly longer than 
 second, yellow; second and third joints black, the third joint about 
 as long as the first two combined, narrower (see fig. 6), with a 
 short sub-apical style. Vertex and upper occiput rather full (see 
 fig. 7), black, the lower occiput and cheeks yellow, occiput largely 
 silvery pollinose, the pile minute and whitish. 

Mesonotum and scutellum shining black, the pile on median 
 portion of mesonotum and on scutellum short, blackish, on margins 
 of mesonotum white. Humeral callosities yellow, silvery pollinose; 
 a silvery pollinose, white pilose spot just back of humeri. Prescu- 
 tellar callosities partly yellow. Pleura shining black, the upper 
 mesopleura, the metapleura and hypopleura silvery pollinose and 
 white pilose. Hal teres white. 

Abdomen largely shining black, rather broad posterior mar- 
 gins of all segments yellowish ; apical half of seventh visible seg- 
 ment lemon yellow ; yellow on first segment reaches lateral margins, 
 on the second to sixth segments it does not do so. Pile of abdomen 
 very fine, sparse, white, longer on sides of first and second. Venter 
 largely brownish yellow, blackish at base, lemon yellow on genitalia. 
 Femora, tibiae, first tarsal joint, apex of fifth and base of claws 
 honey yellow; third and fourth tarsal joints, apex of second and 
 base of fifth blackish. Coxae and trochanters colored like femora, 
 a black spot below on base of trochanters. Wings hyaline, all 
 veins yellow at base, toward apex and posterior margin blackish.

Holotype, a female, collected at Palm Springs, Cal., May 20,

 Sciences. The type a unique. 

This species differs from elegans Coquillett in having the first 
 antennal joint yellow and in the greater extent of black on the 
 abdomen. Coquillett gives no structural characters to distinguish 
 his species. The above described species differs from cincturus 
 Williston, from Mexico, in the smaller size and in the color of the 
 antennae and legs, cincturus having entirely black legs. 

Metacosmus nitidus new species. 

Female. Length 5.5 mm. Head black, a small amount of yel-

 middle of f rons but the lower ocellus nearly in the center ; upper

 shining black, the narrow orbits silvery pollinose. Antennae black, 
 rather short and thick, the second joint larger than first (see fig. 
 4). Upper face and lower frons near base of antennae silvery pol- 
 linose; face short, shining black, distinctly projecting. Occiput 
 thinly gray pollinose, short, sparse white pilose ; on the under side,
