posterior spine of the last pair of each marginal series slightly 
 larger than the others. On the ventral surface there are sparsely 
 scattered hairs, arranged segmentally ; four spiracles located pos- 
 terior to the coxae of the front and middle legs. Anal lobes not 
 chitinized, each with three small ventral and one large terminal 
 setae (Figs. C, D) and two dorso-lateral spines on the inner sur- 
 face. These spines are slightly larger than the cephalothoracic 
 spines mentioned above, not expanded at the base and very blunt. 
 The last pair of the marginal spines are located dorso-laterally 
 near the basal end of the anal lobe (Fig. E). The terminal setae 
 of the anal lobes are about two and one half times as long as the 
 anal lobes themselves (Fig. C), while the eight setae of the anal 
 ring are less than the length of the anal lobes. Antennae medium 
 stout, six to eight segmented (Figs. G, H, I, J,), the normal long

third divided into the third and fourth, and the normal ultimate 
 segment divided into the seventh and eighth. Apparently this di- 
 vision is not closely related to the moults. Legs rather slender 
 (Fig. F), claws not toothed, digitules with flat apical enlargements.
