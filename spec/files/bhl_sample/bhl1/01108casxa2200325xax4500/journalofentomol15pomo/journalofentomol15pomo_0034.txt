 pile; scutellum shining black, with short white pile. Humeral 
 callosities and lower half of pleura gray pollinose. Stem and under 
 part of knob of halteres blackish, the most of knob white. 

Abdomen shining black, finely punctate and with short, sparse 
 whitish pile; hind margins of visible segments one to four narrowly 
 yellowish white, broader on the first. Abdominal pile appears 
 white in certain lights but is largely dark colored. Sternite of

Paratypes. â€” Two females, taken in the type locality, July 8, 
 1919, by Mr. E. P. Van Duzee. 

This species is evidently near M. exilis Coquillett, but differs 
 in the color of the legs and in the wing venation. The only other 
 species in the genus is mancipennis Coquillett an eastern form, 
 which has the face and the stems of the halteres white. 

Acreotrichiis maculipeymis new species. 

A velvety brown species with thickly spotted wings ; the pro- 
 boscis slightly longer than the head. 

Male. Length 4.25 mm. Head black, brownish pollinose, the 
 face and vertex with rather long and erect black pile. Occiput 
 rather flat; occiput and cheeks with black pile. Oral opening 
 large, the antennae placed on the upper edge (see fig. 2) ; first and 
 second anetnnal joints rather slender, the first slightly longer than 
 the second, the third slightly longer than the first two combined 
 and considerably widened near the middle, the style short and 
 subapical (see fig. 2) ; pile on upper side of all antennal joints 
 l)lack. Proboscis black, projecting twice the length of the antennae 
 beyond the oral margin. Palpi black, very slender, with black 
 pile, projecting beyond oral margin about one-third as far as 
 proboscis. 

Thorax black; mesonotum velvety black, shading to a sepia 
 l)rown on the margins; the pile of dorsum erect and yellowish, 
 appearing brown in certain lights. Scutellum velvety black, with 
 comparatively long, coarse yellowish pile. There are indications of 
 two median black vittae on the anterior part of the mesonotum,
