Sept. 2, 1918 — 1 female, elytra deformed. 
 Since there evidently was still another brood, or some larvae 
 were slower in developing, the remainder of the log was kept, and 
 three beetles emerged in 1919 as follows: 

July 24, 1919 — 1 male, large fine specimen. 

July 25, 1919 — 1 male, small specimen. 

Aug. 25, 1919 — 1 female, average specimen. 
 No further attention was paid to the log until April 1, 1920, 
 when out of mere curiosity, it was cut up. To the writer's great 
 surprise one live larva was found. 

It did not appear to be quite full-grown, or at least was a little 
 undersized, and was soft and flabby. Although it was not ex- 
 pected that^t could mature, a hole was bored in the end of a piece 
 of the log, near and parallel to the surface, the larva put in, the 
 hole corked up and the piece of wood placed upside down. The 
 larva soon began to bore into the wood. 

On May 24 it was examined again. The larva had continued 
 boring into the wood, parallel with the bark, filling up the hole 
 behind it, and had turned around in the hole and was headed up- 
 ward. It finally worked a little to one side, and started upward 
 parallel with the other gallery. It was then transferred to another 
 piece of log, and put in a hole bored about 2 inches deep. During 
 the transfer, the photograph of the larva in the gallery shown in 
 Plate I, A, was taken. 

The cork plug was removed frequently and the progress noted. 
 Not much eating was done after the above date, and on July 12 
 the writer was delighted to find that the pupa had formed. It 
 was creamy white, with dark eyes. By August 4 the legs, mouth- 
 parts and head were turning brown, and on August 8 the adult 
 formed. It was put back in the hole and the latter plugged up. 
 The beetle proceeded to the top of the gallery and ate its way up- 
 ward and outward. It emerged from the log on August 23, a 
 medium-sized female. The gallery eaten by the larva between the 
 time it was put in on May 24, and pupation on July 12, in which 
 pupation took place, is shown in Plate I, B — C, and the exit hole 
 eaten by the beetle at C — D. The walls of the gallery made by the 
 larva are much smoother than those made by the beetle as the latter 
 ate its way out. An exterior view of the exit hole is shown in 
 Plate I, F. 

A resume of the above indicates the following:
