XII. Enteropneusta 

For our general knowledge of the central nervous system of 
 this group we have the papers of Spengel, 1884-1894, Bateson, 1886. 

Of the development of the nervous system and the larvae the 
 work began in 1870 with the study of the so-called Tornaria larvae. 
 Bateson, 1884-5, worked out the life history of a Balanoglossus 
 form and later Spengel, '94 and Morgan, '91 and '94 gave an exr 
 tended account of the Tornarian forms, including a good account of 
 the nervous system. Ritter, '94 and Davis, '08, gave stages in the 
 development of Tornaria and Dolichoglossiis, and Herder, 1909, also 
 gave an account of development in which the nervous system was 
 included. 

In various accounts of the position and structure of the nervous 
 system especially as summarized in text books and other places, 
 there seems at times to be some difference in the descriptions but 
 I think for the most part the differences are in the way of express- 
 ing much the same idea so that no real difference is introduced. 

In all cases the nervous system is as a whole epidermal much 
 as in Phoronis and in starfish. The epithelium everywhere is more 
 or less made up of columnar cells at the surface with a deeper 
 nervous layer of fibers, in part branches from the surface cells, and 
 a few deeper cells. In places the epidermic nervous system is 
 more marked. The whole body then might be described as covered 
 with a plexus of nerve cells and fibers ; the thicker parts of the 
 plexus in places form the so-called nerves. The chief nerves of this 
 sort are a dorsal and ventral tract in the body region below the 
 collar with a circular band connecting these at the lower edge of 
 the collar, and a concentration of fibres about the base of the pro- 
 boscis, but the greater concentrations are in the collar itself. In 
 the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the collar just under the epi- 
 dermis is a concentration of nerve cells and fibers but the chief and 
 central concentration of nervous tissues is in the form of a thicker 
 cord running through the cavity of the collar on the dorsal side, 
 although connected with the epidermis at each end. This central 
 nervous system is continuous with the proboscis thickening in front 
 and as just described, with the dorsal and circular nerve tracts 
 behind. 

To summarize, the nervous system may be described as fol- 
 lows : 

1. General epidermal plexus continuous with other parts. 

2. Basal proboscis ring continued into the proboscis by a 
 more diffuse band. 

3. Ventral body nerve continued into ventral collar as a thin 
 layer.
