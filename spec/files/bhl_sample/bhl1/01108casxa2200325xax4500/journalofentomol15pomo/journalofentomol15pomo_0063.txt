9. Nerve cells from central regions of a radial nerve. The ar- 
 rangement is as shown in the drawing, cells of various levels shown 
 as one layer. Some of the processes possibly relate nearby cells, 
 but most fibers run into the general fibrous mass. All fibres or 
 fibrils are small. Thei'e is some indication of tigroid substance in 
 some of the cells. X450.

shaded area. Uexkull, 1897, was of the opinion that the sea-urchin 
 possessed a special set of nerve fibers concerned with photic 
 responses. 

If a bit of the test with one or more spines be separated from 
 the rest of the animal, the spine or spines may be stimulated to 
 react much as before. In the sea-urchins there are several kinds 
 of motile organs. There are the jaw-like organs or pedicellariae, 
 borne on movable stalks ; there are the tube-feet and the long mov- 
 able spines. All these sets of organs are controlled by nerves, and 
 a nerve network connects all these motile organs. One general 
 network of nerves is within the shell and one without, and these are 
 connected with the five radial nerves and the circumoral nerve ring. 
 Each of these motile organs has a definite number of reaction or 
 responses and in these each group may act independently and each 
 organ may react as an independent individual. Each sea-urchin 
 then seems according to Uexkull to be made up of a colony of 
 almost independent structures yet all these are connected by the 
 nerve network and when one carries out a reaction others may 
 receive a stimulus to carry out its special activity. 

The independence of these systems of spines, pedicellariae and 
 tube-feet, and the definite character of their reflexes has been 
 clearly expressed by Von Uexkull He considers the sea-urchins as 
 made up of a "republic of reflexes." Each reflex is of the same 
 value and is independent of the others except for the nerve-net 
 connections between the systems. This group of chiefly independ- 
 ent systems has nothing like a central unity controlling them as a 
 whole and it is only by the synchronous course of different reflexes 
 that a unified action is simulated. The action is not unified but 
 the movements are ordered. Separate reflexes are so constituted 
 and so combined that the simultaneous but independent course of 
 reflexes in response to outer stimulus produces a definite general 
 action similar to the condition in animals with a common center.
