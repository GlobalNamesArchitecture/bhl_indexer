lamellar lobe. In the species thus considered to be fixed as the 
 true interfector of Hentz the ectal margin of the cymbium lacks 
 spines ; the scabrous border ends proximally abruptly in a lobe 
 elevated above the general surface and on which the area of 
 prickles is broader, a very characteristic feature enabling one to 
 detect the species at a glance (Fig. 5). The form of the opening 
 of the epigynal pit is similar to that of hesperus, being partly sub- 
 divided by a projection from each lateral margin and thus differing 
 from that of notius. The spermathecae also present a caudal and 
 an anterior larger lobe connected by a narrower, weakly curved, 
 isthmus.

Mimetus notiiis, sp. nov. 

In this species the opening of the epigynum lacks projections 
 from its lateral margins, and the median dorsal strip is broader and 
 more conspicuous than, e. g., in M. interfector or M. hesperus; the 
 spermathecae are essentially longitudinal as shown in fig. 10. The 
 male differs from all the others here considered in having on the 
 distal portion of bulb of palpus only a single lamellar lobe, the ectal 
 one being absent or represented only by a slight tooth at base of the 
 developed lobe. The ectal margin of the cymbium lacks spines 
 proximad of the apex and its scabrous border runs out gradually, 
 not ending in any such abruptly elevated lobe as occurs in inter- 
 fector.
