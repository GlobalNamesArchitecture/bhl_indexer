Streak dark reddish. Frog much darker than the one in green 
 jar. 

VI. June 21. Green and cold. To see which has the greater 
 effect, the background or the temperature. 

a. Two frogs rather light in color. 

The spots are more distinct but the whole color is lighter 
 than the control. 

b. Two frogs rather dark in color. 

Slightly lighter. The dark colored frogs do not seem to change 
 as readily as the lighter ones. 

These experiments would seem to indicate the greater effects 
 of the background. However there was some chance for error 
 here, because (1) the experiment was only over a period of two 
 hours, and (2) because the frogs objected to the cold water, and 
 when they were not watched, they would climb up out of the water 
 and cling to the side of the jar. 

VII. June 17. I put two frogs in a jar lined with leaves. 
 One frog very reddish, the other grayish green. 

June 21. The grayish green frog much greener, lighter in 
 tone. 

The reddish frog much lighter in tone but still decidedly red- 
 dish in color. 

June 23. The red frog still reddish. 

The green background lightened it but did not change its color. 

VIII. June 17. 5 P. M. Red cover to the bottle. Placed the 
 frogs in the jars. 

June 18. 10 A. M. Slightly darker. Control. Color un- 
 changed. 

June 20. a. About the same shade as the other frog (i. e. the 
 control) only with a more reddish tinge, b. Distinctly lighter, and 
 more reddish in color. 

June 21. Frogs had each a sandy streak down the back. 

The streak brighter reddish. The whole tone of the frog 
 slightly darker than the control. The frogs reversed. Streak 
 sandy colored. 

June 22. Streak brightly reddish. Whole tone of frog much 
 lighter. Streak sandy colored. Darker than the one in red. 

VIII. (a) June 17. 5 P. M. Took two greyish frogs with 
 no particular color showing. Placed one in a jar covered with 
 yellow tissue paper. The other frog used for a control. 

June 18. Much lighter than the control. Seemed to have a 
 yellowish tinge. Spots faded somewhat. 

Reversed the frogs.
