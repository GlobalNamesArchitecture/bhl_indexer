Mr. Richard T. Garnett visited Palm Canyon on May 21 and 
 22, 1917, and after extended search, found an infested log, from 
 which he took 133 adults, 28 pupae and 17 larvae. One fresh exit 
 hole was observed. This and other observations indicate that the 
 period of emergence of the beetles extends from the latter part of 
 May to the early part of September, and it is probable that ovipo- 
 sition also takes place during this period, perhaps continuing a 
 little later. Mr. Garnett observed two sizes of larvae in the log.- 

Only one pupal record was obtained, but judging from this, 
 and the condition of the insects on the various dates the log was cut 
 into or examined, it seems that the pupal period is about one 
 montft, and the adult may remain in the log two weeks from the 
 time it forms until it eats its way out. Plate I, C â€” D, shows that 
 the beetle had to bore nearly an inch from the end of the gallery 
 in which pupation took place to the outside of the log. 

In view of the relatively large numbers of such a rare beetle 
 collected by Mr. Garnett, Mr. Martin and the writer, Hubbard's 
 fears that the insect was about to become extinct are quite un- 
 founded. The two infested logs were found in the same canyon 
 but more than a mile apart.
