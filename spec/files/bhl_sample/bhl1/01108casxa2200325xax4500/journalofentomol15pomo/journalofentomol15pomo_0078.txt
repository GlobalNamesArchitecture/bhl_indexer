Ackerman, 1902, gives figures of the nervous system in Cucii- 
 maria. Retzius, 1906, by means of the silver method gives a 
 mosaic picture of the epidermal cells. Between these cells are 
 small oval fields, the sense cells between the polygonal areas or 
 supportive cells. These are partly between two cells, partly be- 
 tween several supporting cells; they are not regularly arranged. 
 Reimers, 1912, discusses the development of Synapta and gives 
 something of the nervous system. Haanen, 1914, in Mesothuria, 
 is not inclined to accept Herouard's (1890) suggestion that the 
 inner nerve band is chiefly a motor nerve. Very fine intestinal 
 nerves from the circum-oral nerve ring are found in this form as 
 well as the thicker nerves found by other observers. Every ten- 
 tacle and every foot has its own nerve, the first from the circum- 
 oral nerve ring, the second from the radial nerves. The foot 
 nerves are .029 inches broad and smaller and more circular in out- 
 line than the tentacle nerves. There seem to be at least some
