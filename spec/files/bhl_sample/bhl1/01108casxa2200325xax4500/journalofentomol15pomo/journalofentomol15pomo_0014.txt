and the form and position of the spermathecae as revealed in 
 cleared specimens furnish good diagnostic characters. 

Adults of the species here listed may be identified by means of 
 the following keys in conjunction with the accompanying figures of 
 palpi and epigyna. 

Key to Males 

o. Ectal margin of cymbium of palpus with no chitinous, spiniform 
 process proximad of the curved or bent apical one. 

b. Ectal border of cymbium with an elevated and sharply limited 
 lobe at caudal end of scabrous portion of margin, the surface 
 of the lobe covered with minute prickles ; bulb with two apical 
 lamellar lobes (Fig. 5) M. inter fector Hentz 

b.' Scabrous portion of ectal margin of cymbium not ending 
 caudally in any such sharply defined lobe ; apical portion of 
 bulb bearing only one developed lamellar lobe, the ectal one 
 being aborted and at most represented by a minute tooth 
 (Fig. 4) M. notius sp. nov. 

a.' Ectal margin of cymbium with one or two chitinous processes 
 or spines proximad of the apical one. 

b. With only one spine on margin of cymbium proximad of the 
 apical one, this toward the base ; border scabrous from 
 apical to basal spine (Fig. 3) M. epeiroides Emerton 

b/ With two spines on ectal border of cymbium proximad of 
 the apical one of which the more distal one is sometimes 
 weak ; margin scabrous only from apical spine to the more 
 distal marginal one. 

c. Proximal marginal spine contiguous, or nearly so, with 
 basal lobe or auricle of cymbium ; apical portion of bulb 
 with neither lamellar lobe at all sulDdivided or present- 
 ing processes (Fig. 2) M. hesperiii< sp. nov. 

c' Proximal marginal spine well removed from basal lobe 
 of cymbium; apical portion of bulb with the larger, 
 more mesal, lamellar lobe partly subdivided, being 

extended at its mesodistal corner (Fig. 1) 

M. puritanus sp. nov. 

Key to Females. 

a. The opening or pit located at extreme caudal end of epigynum 
 and visible in ventral view, the end in this view appearing 
 notched at the middle; median dorsal strip extending nearly to 
 caudal end of epigynum M. puritanus sp. nov. 

a/ The pit is on the dorsal surface just proximad of caudal end of
