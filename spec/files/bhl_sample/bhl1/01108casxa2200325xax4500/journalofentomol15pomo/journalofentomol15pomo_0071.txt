Notes on the Life History of Dinapate 
 wrightii Horn. (Col.)''

In May, 1916, Mr. J. 0. Martin, of Pasadena, after consid- 
 erable tedious scouting, discovered a log of the Washington Palm 
 (Washmgtonia jilifera) in Palm Canyon, on the Northwestern 
 border of the Colorado Desert, which contained partially-grown 
 larvae of Dinapate ivrightii. Mr. Martin could hear more larvae 
 at work in the log, and decided to mark it and wait until the follow- 
 ing spring for further action. In 1917 he returned to Palm Can- 
 yon and sawed out several pieces from the fallen log, carried them 
 down the canyon to his automobile (a feat which was discovered 
 a little later by the writer to be quite laborious) and transported 
 them to Pasadena.^ 

At the suggestion of Dr. F. H. Chittenden, the writer got into 
 communication with Mr. Martin and received directions to locate 
 the remaining 10 feet of the infested log. On May 19, 1917, the 
 writer went to Palm Springs and duplicated Mr. Martin's actions, 
 except that the scouting was unnecessary. The logs were placed 
 in a wire cage, in Alhambra, and closely watched. Mr. Martin's 
 efforts were rewarded by the appearance of the first beetle on 
 August 3, and emergences continued until thirty-one had appeared 
 by September 17. In the writer's cage 3 adults appeared in the 
 latter part of July, and 2 in August. 

When the sections were sawed from the log, a few larvae were 
 disclosed, some practically full-grown, while others were quite 
 apparently immature, indicating the possibility of two broods. 
 Also after the emergence of the beetles in 1917, larvae could still 
 be heard at work within the log. 

On April 15, 1918, one piece of the log which had been trans- 
 ported to Alhambra, was cut up and examined. Nine larvae were 
 found, four of which were full-grown, and the rest not over half- 
 grown. These larvae were sent to Dr. Chittenden. Also one dead 
 adult female, which had failed to make its way out of the log, 
 was uncovered. The emergences of adults for that year from the 
 remaining piece of log were as follows :

*Since th's paper was presented for publication, an article by Dr. J. A. Comstock on "A 
 Giant Palm-Boring Beetle" appeared in the March, 1922, Bulletin of the Southern California 
 Academa of Sciences (Vol. XXI, Part I). Besides giving many of his observations, it reviews 
 the literature on this interesting beetle.
