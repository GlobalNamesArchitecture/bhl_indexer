bluish gresn, with median ridge and the margins of the body 
 brown. The median ridge was quite prominent in the larva. The 
 coarse reticulum on the body has a pattern somewhat like that 
 figured for M. tristis, as can be seen from the figure. The length 
 was 11 mm. 

The puparium shortens to about 9 mm. The reticulum is much 
 more distinct than in the larva and two prothoracic tubercles push 
 out (in the specimen described one of the tubercles did not push 
 through the body wall). The reticulation is arranged in a more or 
 less symmetrical design and when examined under a high magni- 
 fication is seen to be made up of two types of processes ; those on 
 the dorsal ridge and along the sides just above the fringe are of a 
 shape which might be likened to an inverted wine glass and the 
 other processes are quite short and composed almost entirely of the 
 white stalked portion (see figs. 6 and 7) . The base in both cases is 
 dark brown and the apical portion white. From above the body 
 appears to be covered with white discs arranged in a reticulated 
 pattern, the center of each disc with a depression and a minute 
 cavity which appears to penetrate almost or quite through the 
 body wall. These minute structures may function as pores. The 
 anterior margin of the ventral fringe of the body is deeply notched 
 in the middle as shown in figure 4. The structure of the marginal 
 fringe is shown enlarged in figure 8. The fly emerges from the 
 puparium by breaking off the cover in three rather symmetrical 
 pieces, illustrated in figure 2. 

The specimen described was taken the last of March and soon 
 commenced to pupate, the puparium being fully colored by April 8. 
 The adult emerged just a month later. 

Wheeler notes that the most typical and frequent hosts of t '- " 
 Microdon larvae are ants of the genus Formica but Wasmann has 
 recorded a species ofCamponotus in Madagascar as a host.
