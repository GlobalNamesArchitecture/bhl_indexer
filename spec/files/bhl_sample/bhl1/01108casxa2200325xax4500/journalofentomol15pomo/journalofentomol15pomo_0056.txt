reactions of starfish in considerable detail. In general the star- 
 fish rights itself by twisting about two or three of its- rays until 
 the suckers on the ventral side have a firm hold of the supporting 
 surface and by controlling the twisting movement the body is 
 turned over. In this it is necessary that all five arms do not make 
 the attempt at once to bring the animal into a ventral position. If 
 five or four arms should work at once the animal could not turn 
 over. There must be some coordination between the arms as is 
 seen when the circum-oral nerve is cut. In this case the coopera- 
 tion of the arms ceases. A single arm removed from the rest can 
 right itself. These experiments seem to show that the central 
 nerve ring acts merely as a conductor of impulses. The ventral 
 side of the starfish seems to be positively stereotropic. 

If one arm of a starfish is stimulated the animal moves away 
 in a direction opposite to the stimulated arm. This looks like 
 intelligence, but when one arm is stimulated the tube-feet on this 
 arm draw in ajid according to the parallelogram of forces, a move- 
 ment away from the point of stimulation will take place. When 
 the starfish is stimulated as a whole the spines and pedicellariae 
 wave about and the jaws snap time and again. A separate exter- 
 nal stimulus is not necessary for each opening or closing of a pedi- 
 cellaria. Mechanical stimuli that are strong enough always cause 
 them to attack. Very light mechanical shock often produces no 
 efi'ect even if repeated. There are some responses to food rather 
 than defensive movements, a nutrient juice causes the pedicellariae 
 to advance and open. Pedicellariae are often opened for attack. 
 If another starfish brushes against it, even when one of the indi- 
 vidual's own rays cross, the pedicellariae may be advanced. 

If closed pedicellariae are stimulated they must first be stimu- 
 lated to open before they will attack. Any stimulus which causes 
 the pedicellariae to rise will when repeated cause them to open. 
 Most stimuli which cause the pedicellariae to withdraw also cause 
 them to close. The larger pedicellariae are usually less inclined 
 to hold objects for a long time. Starfish seem to hold objects for 
 a longer time than sea urchins. 

In starfish the pedicellariae seize and hold each other as well 
 as other objects. If a small bit of the body of a starfish, bearing a 
 single spine be cut from the rest, the pedicellariae seize any small 
 object which touches them. If the ventral nerve is cut or the 
 whole ventral side of the ray cut the pedicellariae continue to act, 
 but the cutting of the nerve acts as a stimulus. The transmission 
 of impulses seems to be by the nerve-nets over the body-wall. 

Jennings has shown that the elevation of the groups of pedi- 
 cellariae or the rosettes to attack, is dependent upon the following: 
 1. Previous mechanical stimuli; 2. Preliminary chemical stimuli; 
 3. Foregoing chemical stimuli ; 4. Cutting the radial nerve leaves 
 the rosettes in such a state that they attack more readily than 
 usual. 5. The rising of the rosettes in a central region leaves them
