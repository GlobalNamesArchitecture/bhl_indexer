XIV. Echinodermata 

ASTEROIDEA 

The nervous system of the starfish is about the same in all 
 forms which have been studied. Only minor unimportant differ- 
 ences can be recognized and some of these may be due to the differ- 
 ent conditions under which the observations were made or the 
 different methods employed. 

Along the radial and circumoral ambulacral vessels on the 
 oral side is a median thickening of the surface epithelium. This 
 is the chief part of the nervous system, that is the superficial 
 radial and circumoral system. Separated from these portions by 
 connective substance there are in each arm on each side of the 
 middle line the deep radial bands while within the nerve ring 
 about the mouth there are two deep circumoral bands continuous 
 with the two in each arm. 

From the superficial nervous system fibers may be traced 
 directly to the surface layers of the tube-feet. From the inside 
 nerve rings, fibers follow the ambulacral system. The superficial 
 system is merely a thickening of the epidermis in certain regions 
 while the deep system is a thickening of the surface of the ambu- 
 lacral system. Nerve strands from the circumoral rings, proba- 
 bly from the deep rings, run to the stomach and other viscera. 

In addition to the parts of the nervous system just described 
 there is a rather diffuse network of fibers and probably cells, found 
 in the body-wall outside of the muscles. This last has been called 
 the coelomic. 

Sense cells and perhaps something of a nerve plexus seem to 
 be present below the epidermis all over the aboral and lateral parts 
 of the starfish. Just what relationship all these parts of the ner- 
 vous system bear to each other or how they may be distinguished 
 from each other, has never been made entirely clear. 

Almost any portion of the body seems to be sensitive to touch 
 and there may be other sensations without special organs for their 
 perception. At the tip of each arm a little tentacle or papilla 
 marks the end of the radial canal and the superficial nerve cord. 
 This little organ has a special epithelium and may be a special 
 organ of touch but Eimer, 1880, considers it as an organ of taste. 

The eye-spot is the most marked sense organ of the starfish. 
 Each arm has, very near the termination of the radial nerve at the 
 tip of the arm, a bright red spot of pigment. A little closer exam- 
 ination of one of these spots shows it to be composed of a number 
 of distinct regions of color. In section these little areas are seen 
 to be little follicles lined with epithelial cells. The cells which line 
 the follicles are spoken of as the visual cells. These are clear at 
 their inner margins but pigmented farther down. Their inner 
 processes come into relation with the nerve strands at the bases of
