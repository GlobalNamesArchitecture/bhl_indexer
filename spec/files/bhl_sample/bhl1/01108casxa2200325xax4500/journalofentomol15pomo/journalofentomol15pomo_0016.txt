Mimetus inter fector Keyserling (in part, including those fig- 
 ured), Spinnen Amerikas, Theridiidae 2, 1886, p. 6, pi, 11, fig. 137. 

This species is in the female sex at once distinguishable from 
 all the others in having the epigynal pit at the caudal apex and 
 visible as a median notch from below (Fig. 6). The male may be 
 separated from the other species occurring in the eastern and 
 southern States by the presence of two subapical spines on the ectal 
 margin of the cymbium; and from the western hesperus, as indi- 
 cated above, by the position of the more proximal of these spines 
 and the form of the larger lamellar lobe of the bulb, which is unlike 
 that of any other species (Fig. 1).

Mimetus epeiroides Emerton 

Trans. Conn. Acad. Sci., 1882, 6, p. 17, pi. 3, fig. 4. 

Known only from the male which is clearly distinct from the 
 other species in characters of the palpus. In this the ectal margin 
 of the cymbium possesses a single spine toward the basal lobe, in 
 distinction from the two preceding species in which there are two 
 spines on the margin, and from the two following ones in which 
 there is no marginal spine proximad of the distal one. The ectal 
 border is scabrous over its entire length from apex to basal spine. 
 The terminal portion of bulb bears two lamellar lobes, both of which 
 are simple. 

Type Locality. — Mass. : Essex. 

Immature specimens referred to this species have also been 
 taken by Mr. Emerton at other places in eastern Massachusetts and 
 at Providence, Rhode Island. 

Mimetus interfector Hentz 

Journ. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., 1850, y, p. 3, pi. 4, fig. 12. 13. 

Mimetus tuberosus Hentz, ibid., p. 3, pi. 4, fig. 14. 

Of each of the two species of Mimetus occurring commonly in 
 the southern States, individuals may be found which match the fig- 
 ures of interfector given by Hentz reasonably well. I believe the 
 species to be fixed, however, by the figure of the palpus of the male 
 which, in spite of its general inadequacy, shows two prominent 
 lobes projecting proximad from the bulb that are apparently the 
 two lamellar lobes present in the one species, whereas in the other 
 species, listed below as M. notius, sp. nov., there is but a single
