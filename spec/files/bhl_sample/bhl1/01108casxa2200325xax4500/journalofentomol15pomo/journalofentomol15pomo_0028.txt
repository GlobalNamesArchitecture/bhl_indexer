into two large branches which follow the dorsal line of the epistome. 
 Laterally from the ganglion two other nerve branches go to the 
 epistomal disc. On the ventral surface of the trunk is a medial 
 longitudinal band which is continued into the peduncle. According 
 to Mastermann the mid-dorsal and two lateral epistomal branches 
 have homlogues in Balanglossus and Actinotrocha. 

Rhabdopleura. The account of the structure of Rhabdopleura 
 which is usually given is that of Fowler, 1892. Other accounts 
 which however give little of the nervous system are those of Allman, 
 1869, and Lankester, 1874. 

The central nervous system is represented by a thickening of 
 the ectoderm in the median region of the neck below the nucal pore 
 between the branches of the tentacles. There is a differentiation 
 of nervous tissue much as in Rhabdopleura or Balanoglossus. A 
 black pigment spot is located at the tip of the preoral lobe and may 
 be an eye-spot.
