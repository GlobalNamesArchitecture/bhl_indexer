38 Journal of Entomology and Zoology 

It is hardly possible, as I have pointed out, to formulate a gen- 
 eral system of the group but among the groups examined the 
 Ophiolepidae and the Ophiocomidae are noticeably separate and, 
 containing few local genera of well marked characters can readily 
 be separated both among themselves and from other families. Be- 
 tween the families Ophiofhricidae and Amphiuridae I have found 
 many points of contact as I did also between some Opkiodermatidae 
 and the Amphiuridae. Beyond these generalizations I do not care 
 to advance any opinion. 

Following are my results upon those species examined. Ex- 
 tremes of measurement and a few notes on certain of the more 
 obvious structural details are given. Other details can be made out 
 from study of the plates. 

Ophiocryptus maculosu'< Clark. The smallest specimen meas- 
 ured had its disc one mm. in diameter and with arms one and a half 
 mm. long. Young of this species differ from adults in few skeletal 
 details. The buccal fissures seem less marked and the arms rela- 
 tively longer in proportion to the disc. 

Ophioderma panamenn^^ Lutkin. The smallest specimen 
 measured two mm. across the disc and with arms eight mm. long. 
 Juveniles of this species resemble adults in many points but they 
 differ in others. The disc is set well apart from the arms. The 
 characteristic notches between the arms in the adults are absent. 
 The radial shields are scarcely marked. The branchial spines are 
 set almost at right angles to the arms. Not figured. 

Ophioplocus esmarki Lyman. The smallest specimen meas- 
 ured was one mm. across the disc and with arms eight mm. long. 
 Juveniles of O. esmarki are always distinguishable by pinkish 
 bands crossing the arms. This species is especially interesting on 
 account of the schizogony that young specimens undergo. 

Amphiodia barbarae Lyman. The disc of the smallest speci- 
 men measured was three mm. and the arms twenty-eight mm. long. 
 These are always to be distinguished by the exceedingly long arms 
 at least ten times the diameter of the disc. Young seem to bear 
 many points in common with 0. panamansis. 

Ophioneris annulata Le Conte. Specimens of this species vary 
 from about one half mm. to two mm. in diameter. They undergo 
 schizogony in an unequal plane in certain cases. Like the adults 
 the arms have three flattened arm-spines and with banded arms. 

Opkiopteris papillosa Lyman. Measurements of the smallest 
 specimen in this species found were for the disc three mm. and for 
 the arms ten mm. These are distinguishable by the flat upper arm- 
 plates and coarse arm-spines, but these are both characters that 
 vary even in one specimen. 

Ophiothrix spiculata Le Conte. I found but few specimens of 
 this although the adults are abundant. The smallest specimen 
 measured one mm. in diameter. The reduction in the comparative
