INSTRUCTORS and PURCHASING AGENTS who are on the lookout for newer and 
 better sources for preserved material and slides will be glad to learn that we are better than ever 
 equipped to supply high quality material for the following sciences. 

BOTANY A set of microscopical slides of general 

morphology, which has been declared to 
 be ol better quality and selection than 
 similar sets put out by any other com- 
 mercial firm in the United States. 
 A very complete line of preserved mate- 
 rial, excellent microscopical slides and 
 living material of many forms. 

Microscopical slides of Trypanosoma 
 gambiense, Plasmodium vivax, Trepo- 
 nema pallida in tissue. Entamoeba his- 
 tolytica in sections of the human colon, 
 Necator Americanus and other economi- 
 cally important parasites. Also pre- 
 served material. 

Serial sections of 10 millimeter pig em- 
 bryos, in which a very high standard of 
 technique has been attained. Owing to 
 the method evolved, we are able to quote 
 very attractive prices on these. Serial 
 sections and whole mounts of Chick em- 
 bryos. Preserved pig embi*yos and chick 
 stages. Also slides and preserved mate- 
 rial illustrating the development of the 
 Starfish, Sea Urchin, Lobster Barnacle 
 and certain other invertebrates. 

Excellent preparations of many represen- 
 tative forms. Cartilagenous skeletons 
 are mounted on glass background in 
 liquid. Ligamentous skeletons of bony 
 forms are prepared in such a manner that 
 all parts are properly shown in their 
 manural relations, with the use of visible 
 artificial supports. 

Should either preserved material or 
 slides prove unsatisfactory, advise us and 
 upon return of same we will refund both 
 purcliase price and transportation costs.
