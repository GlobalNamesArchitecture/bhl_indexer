in the cephalic region close to the median line, two pair on each 
 segment of the thorax, two pair each on segments 1 and 2 of the 
 abdomen, one pair each on segment 3, 4, 5 and 6 and three pair on 
 segment 7 of the abdomen. In the submarginal area between the 
 papilla-like pores and the margin is a row of the small circular 
 pores and in addition to these some may be found with no apparent 
 regularity near the bases of the submarginal papilla pores. The 
 sutures of the case are distinct, the last three of the abdomen 
 strongly reflexed caudad. The crenulations of the margin are 
 broad and the incisions shallow. The submarginal area is not set 
 off by a raised ridge or depression. Vasiform orifice subcordate, 
 with the anterior margin straight, the lateral margins with corru- 
 gations or folds extending inward and downward ; operculum 
 shaped similar to that of the orifice with the caudal end slightly 
 truncate, one-half filling the orifice; lingula subspatulate, densely 
 setose, extending about three-fourths of the length of the orifice, 
 bearing at its distal extremity three pair of lateral lobes and a pair 
 of terminal lobes. Thoracic tracheal folds not evident. Just 
 laterad of the anterior margin of the vasiform orifice is a pair of
