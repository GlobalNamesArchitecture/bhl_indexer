By Charles P. Alexander 

Generic Diagnosis 

Larva. Form comparatively short and stout; integument 
 provided with a delicate appressed pubescence; no distinct setae; 
 basal annulus of each of abdominal segments two to seven with a 
 transverse area of microscopic points arranged in long, transverse 
 rows. Last ventral segment with a flattened lobe covered with 
 short setae, evidently an organ for shoving. Spiracular disk 
 entirely without lobes, the spiracles being situated on the exposed 
 dorso-caudal surface of the last abdominal segment. Head-capsule 
 relatively compact ; frontal plate broad, only slightly narrowed 
 behind. Labrum quadrate, with conspicuous, oval, lateral arms ; 
 antennae two-segmented, the terminal segment elongate-oval ; 
 mandibles of a herbivorous type, with an apical point and two 
 incomplete rows of teeth on the inner or cutting face; mental bars 
 widely separated, each bar provided with two acute teeth at its 
 mesal end. 

Pupa. Cephalic crest gibbous, entire or feebly bifid, armed 
 on either side with a single powerful bristle; two bristles on both 
 the front and vertex ; labrum with pair of small bristles at each 
 cephalic-lateral angle ; labial lobes subquadrate, weakly separated 
 by the apex of the labral sheath ; palpal sheaths short and stout, 
 straight ; lateral margins of eye produced laterad into a digitiform 
 lobe; antennal sheaths extending to opposite one-third the wing- 
 sheaths. Pronotal breathing horns lacking, entirely sessile; pro- 
 notum and mesonotum armed with conspicuous bristles ; wing- 
 sheaths ending opposite the base of the third abdominal segment; 
 leg-sheaths long, ending opposite the base of the sixth abdominal 
 segment, the hind legs longest, the middle legs shortest. Abdominal 
 tergites with ten strong bristles, eight being arranged in a single 
 transverse row along the posterior margin ; abdominal pleurites 
 with four strong bristles, one on anterior ring, two near the caudal 
 margin of the posterior ring, one ventrad of the spiracle ; spiracles 
 rudimentary, situated on segments two to seven ; sternites unarmed 
 with bristles. 

Discussion of the Genus 

The genus Cladura was erected by Osten Sacken in 1859 
 (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., p. 229). The genus includes but six
