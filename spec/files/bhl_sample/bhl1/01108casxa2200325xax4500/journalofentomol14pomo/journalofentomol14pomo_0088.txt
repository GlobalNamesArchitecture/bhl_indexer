The Yellow and Black Mucl-dauber, Scelvphroyi servillii Le- 
 peletier.-This interesting dauber is common along all of the streams 
 in the vicinity of Laguna Beach. The elongated mud cells about 
 one inch long are built singly or placed side by side in series of 
 from two to four and the whole covered with a continuous layer 
 of mud completely obliterating the outlines of the individual cells. 
 The cells were commonly placed on the undersides of large rocks 
 or boulders in the near vicinity of the fresh water streams and 
 often at the mouths of the canyons near the ocean. The nests 
 were stored chiefly with yellow and brownish-gray crab spiders. 

In the cells and attacking the larvae of the mud-daubers was 
 often found the maggot of a tachina fly, which proved to be 
 PachyaphtJwlmus fioridcnsis Townsend,,. The adults of this most 
 interesting fly escaped from the masonry cells by the expansion 
 and retraction of an inflatable bladder-like organ in the front of 
 the head (ptilinum?) which was used to moisten the mud and then 
 scrape it away. Adults confined in glass vials were easily observed 
 to continually endeavor to work their way through in this manner. 
 Not all of the flies appeared to possess or to use such an organ, but 
 whether or not this is a sexual characteristic was not determined. 

The fire ant, Solenopsis geminata Fab., was perhaps the com- 
 monest ant in the vicinity of the laboratory. During July the 
 ants were swarming from their ground nests in great numbers. 
 The workers are small, entirely reddish or with small rounded black 
 abdomens, the winged females are reddish throughout while the 
 winged males are black.
