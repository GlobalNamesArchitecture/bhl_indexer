 plate are black and as illustrated (Figure 1, W. cauda). 

Relationship — This species has been carefully checked with 
 Aphis reticulata Wilson, A. oregonensis Wilson, A. hermistonii Wil- 
 son, A. tridentatae Wilson, A frigidae Oestlund, and Aphis arte- 
 miscola Williams occurring in Oregon on Artemisia trideyitata, and 
 does not agree with any of them or other closely related species.

 of old man or California sage, Artemisia calif ornica Less. 

Locality — In Laguna Canyon one-half mile above Laguna

Date of Collection — July 13, 1921.

 viduals. The cotypes are in the author's collection. 

The species is named after Dr. Wm. A. Hilton, Professor of 
 Zoology, Pomona College, under whose supervision, inspiration and 
 energy a most wonderful type of biological instruction is being
