A Cataloe of the California Aleyrodidae 

and the Descriptions of Four 

New Species 

By Donald D. Penny 

Introduction 

This paper consists of a list of the ah^eady described species of 
 Aleyrodidae, or white flies, taken from the State of California, and 
 a record of their food plants and localities together with the descrip- 
 tions of four new species. 

The writer has not attempted to give a systematic arrange- 
 ment of the family in this paper but has laid much stress on the 
 completeness of the list of food plants upon which the different 
 species have been taken in order that from a knowledge of the food 
 plants the family will be more readily accessible and at the same 
 time may be kept up to date in respect to the host records. 

In the collecting of specimens the writer has not been con- 
 fined to any one section of the state but has taken and received 
 specimens from a wide range of localities, including sections of 
 both high and low elevation, from the extreme north to the extreme 
 south of the state. This has resulted in the recording of some new 
 hosts for the already described species as well as the finding of 
 the four new species herein described. 

The writer desires to thank Professor E. 0. Essig for the 
 many specimens given and other kind assistance rendered during 
 the preparation of this paper. 

Paratypes of the author's new species have been deposited 
 with the collection of the California Academy of Sciences, Golden 
 Gate Park, San Francisco, California.
