This species I am not at all certain about but my specimens 
 seem to agree very well with descriptions and keys of both Nutting 
 and Torrey. If the identification should prove correct the species 
 has a much more southerly distribution than hitherto reported. 
 Calkins reports it from Puget Sound but Torrey has not included 
 it in his descriptions. The species is decidedly northern. 

The gonangia of my specimens are a little fuller and with more 
 pronounced opercula than that figured by Nutting, but as those of 
 my specimens are ripe and those figured by Nutting are not this 
 may be of little significance. 

Specimens on thalli of a seaweed, probably Macrocystis, exact 
 source unknown. Bottle labeled. Illingsworth, Pacific Grove, 
 July, 1899. Many ripe gonangia.
