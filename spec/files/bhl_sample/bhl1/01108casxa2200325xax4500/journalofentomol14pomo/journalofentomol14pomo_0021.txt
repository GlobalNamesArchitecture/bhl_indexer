Hydroids Near Laguna Beach 

Arthur S. Campbell 

The hydroid fauna of Laguna Beach has been little studied but 
 there are a number of interesting forms to be found there. A few 
 collections, made almost at random from time to time, and with 
 no special search, form the basis of these notes. 

The excellent papers by Torrey, Calkins, and Nutting have been 
 freely consulted in making the determinations. The splendid mon- 
 ograph by C. C. Nutting is especially invaluable to all who may have 
 to do with a systematic discussion of the group. 

The more valuable results of this short paper are the distribu- 
 tional and systematic records, together with notes concerning 
 ecological and breeding relations. More extensive studies will re- 
 veal much data not hitherto brought to light concerning the 
 ecology, life-histories, variations, and other bionomical details of 
 the group in this interesting locality.
