The Christmas berry thrips, Trichothrips ilex Moulton, occurs 
 in all stages upon the tree malva, Malvastrum fasciculatum (Nutt.) . 
 The young are bright cardinal red with the head, antennae, dorsum 
 of prothorax, legs, and last abdominal segment black. The adults 
 are entirely black. The insects feed on the stems and under- 
 sides of the leaves and the brilliant red nymphs are often present 
 in considerable numbers. 

This species also attacks the Christmas berry, Heteromeles 
 arbutifolia (Lindl.) and a variety Trichothrips ilex dumosa Moulton 
 occurs in southern and central California on scrub oak, Quercus 
 dumosa Nutt.

The Crackling cicada, Cacama crepitans (Van Duzee).- One 
 of the most interesting insects in the hill region is the crackling 
 cicada, so-called from the various crackling sounds intermingled 
 in the long sonorous buzzing or droning which is at times so deaf- 
 ening. When captured they make a terrific high-pitched noise. 
 The adults may be observed resting near the tops of various shrubs, 
 but appear to prefer the California sage, Artemisia calif ornica 
 Less. 

The black scale, Saissetia oleae (Bern.) , is abundant at Laguna 
 Beach, having been dispersed far over the hills infesting many 
 native plants including the California sage, Artemisia calif ornica 
 Less., willows {Salix spp.), and the lemonade or sour berry, Rhus 
 integrifolia B. & H. 

The Cabbage Bug, - Miirgantia histrio7iica Hahn.- The native 
 black phase of this species, described as M. nigricans by Cockerell, 
 occurs in great numbers upon the wild mustard. Brassica cam- 
 pestris Linn., and more particularly upon the wild bladder-pod, 
 Isomeris arborea Nutt., growing on the sea coast hills and in the 
 valleys of Southern California. On the latter plant it overwinters 
 and survives the dry years when the mustard fails to appear. The 
 writer believes that the above form of the cabbage bug has long 
 been a resident of Southern California where for ages it has sub- 
 sisted upon the two plants listed and should be considered as a 
 native insect. 

The eggs are often heavily parasitized by a minute black 
 encyrtid, Ooencyrtus johnsoni (Howard) ■. Adults of this parasite 
 were reared from eggs taken chiefly from the wild bladder-pod 
 growing on the hills near the ocean from Balboa Beach to San Juan 
 C^apistrano. They issued in greatest numbers during the month 
 of July.
