Asterochiton corollis, new species 
 Pupa-case: — Size 0.90 mm. by 0.61 mm.; shape elliptical with 
 the caudal end truncate; color dark brown. The wax secretion of 
 the dorsum, as observed from somewhat imperfect specimens, con- 
 sists of three separate systems as follows ; first, a continuous mar- 
 ginal fringe extending entirely around the case, the rods of which 
 are short and loosely joined, projecting directly toward the leaf 
 to about one-half of the distance from the margin to the leaf. 
 Second, a series extending continuously around the case just within 
 the margin. The rods of this system are long, white and closely 
 coalesced at their bases and extend upward for the greater part 
 of their lengths then outward over the case, separating into ribbon- 
 like structures at their extremities. Third, a series of short, thick 
 rods arranged in groups which arise mesad of the second system 
 and which project toward the center of the case. In addition to 
 the dorsal wax the pupa case secretes a high vertical fringe of 
 wax on which the case rests. The submarginal area bears a row 
 of large, conical, papilla-like pores the bases of which are close 
 together, the pores themselves measuring about 0.02 mm. in 
 length. These pores undoubtedly secrete the long ribbon-like wax 
 structure. On the dorsum proper are irregularly shaped, con- 
 spicuous, pore-like openings which are arranged in groups, the 
 outer margins of which conform to the general curve of the case. 
 These groups are found as follows : two in the cephalic region con- 
 sisting of fourteen pores each, two in the thoracic region containing 
 about twelve openings each and two in the abdominal region con- 
 taining twenty-four each. Scattered through these pores are numer- 
 ous very small circular pores also two pair of similar circular pores
