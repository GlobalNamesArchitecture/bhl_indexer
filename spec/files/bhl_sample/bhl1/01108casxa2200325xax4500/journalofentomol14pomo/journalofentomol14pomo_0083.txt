The Occurrence of Polygordius Adult 
 at Laguna Beach 

William A. Hilton 

For a number of years now we have taken Branchiostoma just 
 off shore in rather coarse sand, but it was not until the summer of 
 1920 that we began to look for archiannelids. A few doubtful 
 specimens were obtained from sea weeds but nothing that we could 
 be sure were the animals sought. We never thought to search the 
 sand in which Branchiostoma was taken until after reading in the 
 monograph on Polygordius how the creatures were obtained near 
 Naples. With the hint that these animals were sometimes asso- 
 ciated we examined with great care some hundreds of pounds of 
 coarse sand in which some few Branchiostoma had been found and 
 from this two specimens were obtained, one dead and one living. 
 These were without question of the genus Polygordius although to 
 make. the matter more certain sections were made. Although the 
 genus is certain, the species remains undetermined because the 
 caudal ends of the animals were not perfect. 

The living specimen was very active. At first it was taken to 
 be a rather long round worm but the characteristic antennae at the 
 head region caused it to receive more attention. 

So far as I can tell, this is the first record of the adidt of Poyl- 
 gordius being found in North America in its natural environment 
 at least, for some have been reared from the larval forms at Woods 
 Hole.
