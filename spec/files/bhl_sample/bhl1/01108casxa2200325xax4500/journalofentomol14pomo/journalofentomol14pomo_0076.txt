system. There are no concentrations any place to form a ganglion ; 
 the chief nervous system lies ventrally. Two longitudinal nerve 
 tubes or nerve bands are described running the length of the body. 
 The nerve strands may give the appearance of tubes due to shrink- 
 age ; epithelial cells seem to compose it and the tissue does not look 
 like nervous tissue. These longitudinal tubes or nerves may be 
 some sort of sense organ. 

Cori, 1890, adds nothing to the general knowledge of the nerv- 
 ous system. 

Torrey, 1911, in P. pacifica gives a partial description of the 
 nervous system as like that of P. architecta with the exception that 
 "The two longitudinal cords which are of exceedingly unequal 
 length, instead of continuing in the nerve ring of the lopophore, are 
 continuous across the median line at the level of the median mass 
 of ganglion cells. The loop thus formed is closely applied to the 
 latter and touches the lophophore nerve on each side of the rectum, 
 apparently without fusing at either point." I have found no such 
 condition in several good series of well stained Phoronis pacifica. 
 Either this was an individual difference or Torrey's material was 
 poorly fixed. 

Schultz, 1903, discusses the regeneration of the central nervous 
 system. 

De Selys-Longchamps, 1907, described the circular nerve ring 
 and ganglion and the lateral nerve of Caldwell on the left. 
 Pixell, 1912, discusses two new species of Phoronida. 

In Phoronis vayicouvereyisis, there is the usual ring of nervous 
 tissue at the base of the lophophore ; from it five nerves continue up 
 the tentacles. Across the dorsal surface in front of the anus is a 
 large ganglionic mass composed of fibers and cells with large nuclei. 
 This tissue is everywhere in intimate relation with the inner ends 
 of the epithelial cells. In some sections two small lateral nerve 
 cords ran along the right and left sides of the body close to the 
 point of attachment of the lateral mesenteries and projected into 
 the basement membrane. He describes these as, "punctated tis- 
 sue." They are very short. Nervous tissue was found in the 
 center of the pit at the proximal end of the body and also along the 
 alimentary canal on the outer side of the epithelium especially 
 marked in the region of the oesophagus opposite the nerve ring. 
 Gilchrist, so he says, suggests this patch as an organ of taste. 

Phoronapsis hamesi has a similar condition of the nerve ring 
 but the ring is narrower and more elongated than in Phoronis. A 
 conspicuous nerve cord extends down the left side. In the neph- 
 ridial region it is separated from the epithelium and embedded in 
 the basement membrane; after passing internally to the nephridial 
 duct it turns outwards and rejoins the epithelium a little to the 
 oral side of the lateral mesentery. From here it extends as a con-
