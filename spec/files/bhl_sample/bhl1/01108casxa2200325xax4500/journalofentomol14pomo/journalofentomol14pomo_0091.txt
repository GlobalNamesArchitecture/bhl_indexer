border of the superior adductor muscles. A large ventral commis- 
 sure unites the ganglia under the oesophagus. Each ganglion fur- 
 nishes the following nerves: (1) to the adductor inferior muscle, 
 a nerve with a little branch to the internal oblique muscle, (2) a 
 nerve to the dorsal part of the mantle, (3) a nerve to the ventral 
 part of the mantle, (4) a nerve to the arm, (5) branches which join 
 with the ventral oesophageal commissure, (6) several nerves form- 
 ing the dorsal nerve commissures. The dorsal commissure has 
 nerves going to the cirri. 

All nerves are under the skin. Cirri are probably organs of 
 touch. 

Heath, 1889, has found sensitive striae formed by high epith- 
 elial cells connected with the ganglion cells. These areas are along 
 the middle line on the ventral side. 

In spite of fragmentary and conflicting evidence the following 
 seems clear as the nervous system of brachiopods : 

A nerve ring surrounds the oesophagus ; this is enlarged on 
 the dorsal side in a small inconspicuous ganglion near the base of 
 the lip. A larger suboesophageal ganglion is the thickening on 
 ventral side. The ventral ganglion and perhaps the dorsal retain 
 their primitive connections with the surface layer of the skin. Both 
 ganglia give off a nerve each side to the arms and along the base 
 of the tentacles and lips. The ventral ganglion also gives off nerves 
 which supply the dorsal and ventral folds of the mantle and the 
 muscles. In some cases the dorsal ganglion seems to be repre- 
 sented by a dorsal band only. 

Sense organs are doubtful ; the margins of mantle and cirri 
 may have a tactile function and the epithelium on the surface of 
 the ganglia have been suggested as olfactory areas.
