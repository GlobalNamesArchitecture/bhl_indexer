a pair of similar waxen rods arising in the cephalic region and 
 extending upward over the case, a pair each on two segments of 
 the thorax and on segments 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the abdomen. In addi- 
 tion to the dorsal secretion the case bears a continuous high, ver- 
 tical fringe of coalesced, white, wax rods which extend from the 
 margin of the case to the leaf. This wax functions as a support 
 for the case and it remains firmly attached to the leaf when the 
 case is removed. The pores which give rise to the dorsal wax 
 secretion are large, 0.012 mm. in length, conical in shape and are 
 arranged in a rather irregular submarginal row of about sixty in 
 number; also a pair of similar pores in the cephalic region, a pair 
 each on the two segments of the thorax and a pair each on segments 
 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the abdomen. Between the bases of the submarginal 
 wax pores may be found very small circular pores, a row of similar 
 circular pores between these and the margin of the case, and along 
 the dorso-meson from the cephalic region to the vasiform orifice a 
 pair for each segment, though occasionally missing on some seg- 
 ments. Segments of the dorsum are distinct and in the abdominal 
 region the sutures are strongly bent caudad. Vasiform orifice sub- 
 cordate, length 0.06 mm., anterior margin straight, inner lateral 
 margins with corrugations extending downward. Operculum sub- 
 semielliptical, about one-half filling the orifice. Lingula slightly 
 hidden, subspatulate, densely setose, projecting slightly beyond the 
 orifice and bearing at its distal extremity a pair of terminal and 
 three pair of lateral lobes. Submarginal area not set off from the 
 dorsum by a raised ridge or depression. Thoracic tracheal folds not 
 visible. Conspicuous caudal spines present, arising just within the 
 caudal margin, but cephalo-marginal and latero-caudal marginal 
 spines absent. 

Adult female: â€” Length 1.0 mm., general color yellow to 
 orange, eyes very dark brown, constricted but not divided. Fore- 
 wing length J. 15 mm., radial sector, media and cubitus present. 
 The radial sector is the main vein of the wing extending through 
 the central area. The media is reduced to a remnant, being very 
 short and faint and arising as a branch of the radial sector. The 
 cubitus appears as a cleared line arising independently of the radial 
 sector and projecting caudad toward the margin then paralleling it 
 for a very short distance before ending. The portion of the wing 
 through which the cubitus passes is very slightly dusky or unclear 
 thus making the cleared vein more distinct.* Length of antennae 
 segments from segment 1 to segment 7 inclusive, as follows : 0.024 
 mm., 0.052 mm., 0.128 mm., 0.048 mm., 0.064 mm., 0.044 mm., 
 0.040 mm. Paronychium blade-like. 

This species was described from an abundance of pupae and 
 several adults taken by the writer on tarweed {Chamaebatia 

*This type of vein is spoken of by Bemis (Proceedings of the U. S. Nat 
 Museum, vol. 27, page 493) as a long, oblique, anal fold.
