kno\yn species, with a Holarctic distribution, there being two 
 species from eastern North America, one from wester i 
 North America, and three from Japan. Of the eastern North 
 American species, the most common and best-known is the geno- 
 type, Cladura flavoferruginea. The six known species of the genus 
 are all forms that appear on the wing in late summer and in 
 autumn. 

The only reference to the immature stages of this curious 
 genus is the brief diagnosis by the writer (The Crane-flies of New 
 York, Part II. Biology and Phylogeny. Cornell University Agri- 
 cultural Experiment Station. Memoir 38. p. 949 ; 1921 ) . The geno- 
 type is common and widely distributed throughout the northeastern 
 United States, but until the present year the writer had been 
 unable to locate the immature stages. The conditions under which 
 these stages occur are briefly outlined herein. 

Augurville, or Brownsfield, Woods, near Urbana, Illinois, is 
 an open, low Transitional or upper Austral woodland, traversed 
 in spring and early summer by a small stream. In early 
 spring the valley through which this brook flows is car- 
 peted with a dense growth of Blue-eyed Mary {Collinsia verna) . 
 On the higher ground and dry slopes, other characteristic 
 spring flowers, such as Trillium recurvatum, Claytonia 
 virginica. squirrel-corn, dutchman's breeches, blood-root, white 
 trout-lily, and other forms, occur in numbers. The forest cover 
 consists of linden, hard maple, buckeye, hackberry, bur oak, honey- 
 locust, and a few less common species, certain individuals of all of 
 these species being giants of their kind and evidently members of 
 the primitive forest. The undergrowth consists principally of 
 pawpaw and spice-bush, together with considerable reproduction 
 of buckeyes and other trees. In the autumn, the vernal flora is 
 replaced by the dominant wood-nettle, many species of Aster and 
 Solidago, some Eupatorium and other late summer plants. Adults 
 of Cladura flavoferruginea were found in these woods during the 
 fall of 1919. 

On September 5, 1920, Mrs. Alexander and the writer began 
 a systematic search for the larvae of Cladura. Earlier experience 
 in Maine, New York, and Kansas had demonstrated that it was 
 highly improbable that the early stages were to be found in mud, 
 or even in damp earth, or in decaying wood, these habitats being 
 those commonly frequented by the early stages of the Tipulidae. A 
 careful search was instituted in soil that was baked comparatively 
 hard and dry. The lumps were dug out and crumbled into dust, the 
 contents being carefully examined. This method of search soon 
 revealed a short, stout, light yellow crane-fly larva, that was at 
 once determined as probably being that of Cladura. On this date, 
 the only other insects associated with this larva were larvae of the 
 Scarabaeid, Xyloryctes satyrus (Fabr.), a Tenebrionid, Meracan- 
 tha contracta (Beauv.), and a few adult Corabidae and Staphy-
