is found in the tentacles where there is a combination of sensory 
 cells at the base of the sense organ. 

The retrocerebral apparatus in Eosphora consists of two glands 
 lying back of the brain. They are covered with membrane and so 
 not in direct connection with the brain. One of these glands is the 
 pear-shaped retrocerebral sac which is clear with vacuoles. If 
 this is in any way a sense organ it is a question what its function 
 would be. 

In Eosphora there is a single eye on the surface of the brain 
 and two slightly pigmented knobs at the anterior margin of the 
 animal; these have a direct connection with the brain and must be 
 sense organs, possibly something like eye spots. 

Gastrotricha. In 1864 Gosse described a knob on the oesoph- 
 agus as the brain in Chaetonotus. Ludwig in 1875 described the 
 nervous system on the side of the brain. Butschli, 1876, added 
 nothing of importance and Fernald, 1890, did not see the brain in 
 Chaetonotus. The clearest recognition of the nervous system was 
 by Zelinka in 1890. A large brain in the head region surrounds 
 the gullet above and on the sides and a pair of nerve trunks extend 
 down the body. Cephalic sense hairs are directly connected with 
 nerve cells of the brain. The hairs of the body may be for touch 
 or possibly smell or taste. Simple eyes have been described for a 
 number of species in the back part of the head, as small red spots, 
 but not all species possess them. 

KiNORHYNCHA. Claparede in 1863 describes a nervous sys- 
 tem in this group and others at an early time also figure or describe 
 something of the nervous system. Reinhard, 1887, believes that in 
 most cases the nervous system was not seen by the earlier investi- 
 gators. He describes and figures a ganglion on the oesophagus but 
 gives no details. Zelinka, 1894, describes a circum-oral ring and a 
 long ventral nerve strand. Schepotieff, 1907, describes a brain 
 above the oesophagus with two connectives and a ventral strand. 
 The nervous system is somewhat like that of Gastrotrichia with a 
 large upper brain of a large mass of three general parts all fused. 
 The ventral strand runs the length of the body but is not differen- 
 tiated into ganglia but has cells along its course. Eye spots have 
 been described in some species, the number being from 2-8.
