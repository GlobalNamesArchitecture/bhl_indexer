the form of a U, with the concavity fitted to the anal side of the 
 oesophagus in an oblique position with arms turned slightly up- 
 wards. The end of each makes a turn in the oral direction, and is 
 continuous with a large nerve trunk which goes to the lophophore 
 arm. The ganglion is in direct connection with the inner cell layer 
 of the oesophagus, the outer layer of the latter enveloping it on all 
 sides. The lophophore nerve trunks are likewise located between 
 the outer and inner layers of the body- wall; they run beneath the 
 outer layer of the lophophore covered below by epithelium. The 
 ganglion contains a large cavity extending to the ends of the gan- 
 glion. The wall of the ventricle is very thin and epithelial in 
 nature on all sides but the bottom on the anal side, where it is very 
 thick as it joins the main part of the ganglion. This thick portion 
 is distinctly separated from the epithelial part and is well seen in 
 the fresh state as a somewhat reddish mass with a slight constric- 
 tion in the median plane of the polype. It is this part that Hyatt 
 took for the ganglion which he described as composed of two lateral 
 masses connected by a thick commissure. The epithelial part is 
 hard to recognize in surface views. A cross section of the lop- 
 hophore trunks is kidney-shaped ; in it the nerve cells are much 
 crowded ; the nerve cells are spindle-shaped, bipolar, with nuclei 
 in the middle, closely packed together with few fibers between. 
 The nerve trunks are thick and large as compared with the ganglia. 
 The matter of a circum-oesophageal ring was not settled ; this 
 author did not find it. The colonial nervous system found in some 
 marine Bryozoa for the purpose of controling the movements of 
 the members of the colony seem to be entirely lacking in the species 
 Pectinatella gelatinosa, and this fact agrees with the behavior of 
 the animals as they act independently. 

Cori, 1893, does not give much further information about the 
 nervous system of bryozoans. 

Delage and Herouard, 1897, in a number of diagrams show the 
 position of the ganglion in marine ectoprocts as being a single small 
 ganglion ventral to the oesophagus. There are probably nerves 
 going to the tentacles, to the body and to the alimentary canal, but 
 these are not clearly shown in any case. A ganglion in the avicu- 
 larium is shown by Delage and Herouard and they indicate by a 
 series of diagrams how this ganglion might have been derived from 
 a single zooid by a series of gradual transformations. 

Ladewig, 1900, shows such a ganglion center in an avicularium 
 of a marine ectoproct. 

The sensory system of ectoprocts has been described by 
 Nitsche on the tentacles of AlcyoneUa as stiff bristles to which he 
 ascribes the sense of taste. Verworn, Kraepelin, Braem and others 
 have seen these without ascribing special functions to them. It 
 seems probable that the tentacles must have some special sense 
 organs for touch or other senses.
