has no especial markings or features other than the impressions 
 made by the bones which come in contact with it. On its ventral 
 surface are two long narrow impressions left by the squamo- 
 palatines. 

The sphenethnoids (12) are the bones which serve as walls to 
 hold apart the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the skull. They are 
 rather long bones, about three-fourths as long as the parasphenoid. 
 They articulate posteriorally with the occipitals, their dorsal edge 
 articulates with the frontals and parietals, their ventral edge with 
 the parasphenoid. Anteriorally they bound a portion of the open- 
 ings into the occipital fossae. 

The mandibles of Notofhalamus forosits are each composed of 
 two bones, the dentary and the articulare. 

The dentary (14) is that part of the mandible which bears the 
 teeth. It is a long slender, curved bone, articulating anteriorally 
 with the other dentary, and widening out posteriorally to articulate 
 with the articulare. 

The articulare (15) is that part of the mandible which diverges 
 posteriorally to form a rounded knob which fits into the articular 
 socket of the quadrate. Anteriorally, on the median side it fits 
 down into the dentary bone.
