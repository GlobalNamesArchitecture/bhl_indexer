Masterman's paper of 1898 is a very important one. He men- 
 tions Wagner, '47, as the first to describe the nervous system. Mas- 
 terman describes a central ventricular ganglion in the mid-dorsal 
 line at the base of the prae-oral lobe, composed of ganglion cells 
 and fibers. The ganglion is a proliferation of the inner cells of the 
 epiblast. Nerve tracts radiate in almost every direction. 

The nervous system may be summarized as follows : 

1. Central ganglion in front collar region and between this 
 and the prae-oral lobe. The epiblast in front is depressed to form a 
 neuropore. 

2. A ring about the posterior part of the collar is continued 
 dorsally and ventrally giving off fine double groups of nerve tracts 
 to the anal end of the body. 

3. Groups of fine nerve tracts continued dorsally along the 
 trunk from the anterior end of the collar.
