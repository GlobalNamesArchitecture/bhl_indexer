rudimentary spiracle, the remaining two in a transverse row on 
 the posterior ring near the caudal margin ; on the eighth pleurite 
 there is a single bristle. On the sternites, no bristles. Terebra 
 of the ovipositor ending almost on a common level, the tergal valves 
 a very little longer; each tergal valve terminates in four rather 
 weak bristles. In the male pupae, the sternal valves are slightly 
 more tumid and project beyond the level of the tergal valves.
