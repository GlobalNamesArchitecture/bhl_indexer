Lingula partially obscured, spatiilate, distal end spherical and 
 densely setose. The submarginal area bears a continuous row of 
 conspicuous circular pores which are about 0.014 mm. in diameter 
 and which project somewhat from the case. The submarginal 
 area is set off from the dorsum proper by a raised ridge which is 
 continuous around the case save in the cephalic region. The cren- 
 ulations of the margin are broad and well rounded, the incisions 
 shallow. Marginal wax tubes project mesad about one-third the 
 width of the margin. Thoracic tracheal folds not evident. A pair 
 of fine, delicate caudal spines are present just within the caudal 
 margin, set in tubercled bases. On the suture lines extending 
 cephalad from the vasiform orifice is a pair of very fine delicate 
 hairs set in circular bases. Cephalo-lateral and caudo-lateral mar- 
 ginal spines are lacking. 

Adult : â€” Length about 0.65 mm. ; color yellow with the head 
 and thorax lighter. Eyes dark red, constricted but not divided. 
 Wings immaculate, forewing with Radius 1, cubitus and media 
 present; media short, faint and poorly defined. Paronychium 
 blade-like. The antennae of all specimens were broken.
