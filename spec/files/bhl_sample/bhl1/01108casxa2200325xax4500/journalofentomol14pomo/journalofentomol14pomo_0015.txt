The coloration of newly transformed pupae is pale yellow. In 
 older individuals, the thorax, head and sheaths of the appendages 
 gradually deepen in intensity to almost black in specimens about 
 to transform. 

Cephalic crest projecting between the antennal bases as a 
 gibbous lobe that is entire or microscopically bifid, on either side 
 with a conspicuous erect bristle situated immediately dorsad of 
 the base of the antenna. Vertex between the cephalic ends of 
 the eyes with a strong bristle on either side, immediately caudad 
 of each of which is a small tubercle. Frontal region likewise with 
 a pair of strong bristles that are somewhat appressed against the 
 face, directed caudad. Labral sheath with the apex rounded, very 
 narrowly separating the labial lobes ; at the base of the labrum o^^ 
 either side are two small bristles ; sheaths of the palpi short but 
 stout. Lateral margin of the eyes produced laterad and slightly 
 caudad and dorsad into a conspicuous finger-like lobe. Antennal 
 sheaths extending to about opposite one-third the length of the 
 wing-sheath. 

Pronotal breathing horns entirely lacking, the pores being 
 sessile, lying immediately dorsad of the antennal sheaths. Prono- 
 tal scutum with two weak bristles behind the antennal sheaths ; pro- 
 notal scutellum with three powerful bristles on either side near the 
 summit. Mesonotum gibbous but unarmed with tubercles or spines. 
 The following mesonotal bristles are evident : one on the ventral 
 caudal angle immediately cephalad of the wing-root ; a group of two, 
 one being much smaller than the other, immediately at the wing- 
 root ; a transverse row of three strong bristles on either side, dor- 
 sad and proximad of the wing-root; two weak bristles slightly ceph- 
 alad of the level of these latter three, one on either side of the me- 
 dian line ; a strong bristle dorsad and cephalad of the pair at the 
 wing-root. Metanotum with a strong bristle at the ventral cephalic 
 angle. Wing-sheaths extending to opposite the base of the third ab- 
 dominal segment. Leg-sheaths long, extending to opposite the base 
 of the sixth abdominal segment ; sheaths of the posterior legs long- 
 est, a little exceeding those of the fore-legs ; middle legs shortest, 
 ending immediately beyond the base of the last segment of the 
 posterior sheaths. 

Abdominal tergites and pleurites with very conspicuous bris- 
 tles ; sternites entirely unarmed. The distribution of the setae is 
 as follows : On the tergites — no setae on the anterior annulus ; on 
 the posterior annulus a single transverse row of eight long bristles 
 along the posterior margin of the segments, four on either side of 
 the median line ; cephalad of the outermost pair of these bristles 
 and located on the anterior part of the posterior annulus is a single 
 strong bristle on either side ; on the eighth tergite there are only 
 four Wistles, arranged to form a rectangular or trapezoidal figure. 
 On the pleurite>, — each pleurite bears four very powerful bristles, 
 one opposite the anterior annulus, one immediately ventrad of the
