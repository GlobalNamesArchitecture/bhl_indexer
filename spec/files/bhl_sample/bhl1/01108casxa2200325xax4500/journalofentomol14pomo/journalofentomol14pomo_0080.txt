4. A ring about the anal end of the trunk into which dorsal 
 and ventral tracts lead. 

5. A ring about edge of prae-oral lobe, joined at each side to 
 the ganglion and in median front region by three main tracts run- 
 ning in mid-dorsal line. 

6._ A diffuse plexus of fibers at the base of all the epiblastic 
 layer, including fibers of ventral collar region, which pass forward 
 and dorsally to meet the ganglion. 

Ineda, 1901, found no collar, nerve ring or dorsal or ventral 
 commissure in the larva. He also failed to make out presence of 
 the peri-anal ring. If present it is represented by a small number 
 of parallel fibers. The main nerves were three in number close to 
 each other and parallel along the mid-dorsal line of the trunk but 
 confined to only a few sections posterior to the first pair of tentacles. 
 There was found however a very complex and beautiful system of 
 nerve fibers seen on the prae-oral lobe. Fibers are very numerous 
 and fine and radiate from the ganglion on all sides towards the free 
 margin of the prae-oral lobe. In the median line and anterior to 
 the ganglion fibers are three long parallel strands on which the 
 apical sensory spot is situated, not far from the ganglion. After 
 passing through the sensory spot strands fray out into fine fibers 
 which continue to the free margin of the prae-oral lobe. Fibers 
 from the ganglion do not show a regular radial arrangement, but 
 arise from the lateral edge of the ganglion and soon take an anterior 
 direction. Sometimes near the ganglion there is an anastomosis of 
 fibers, but probably more apparent than real. There are nerve end- 
 ings in the prae-oral ciliated belt. There is probably an incomplete 
 development of nerve elements in the collar and trunk region. He 
 finds no neuropore ^nd believes that Masterman's structure is due 
 to contraction. 

De Selys-Longchamps, 1902, gives a rather complete descrip- 
 tion of the nervous system. The central ganglion is a dorsal ex- 
 pansion of the epidermis with fibrillar substance below the surface. 
 The depression which Masterman calls neuropore is not such a 
 structure. There are three cords of the nervous system, the median 
 is most developed. The apical organs are organs of sense.
