with the similar multipolar network over the surface of the indi- 
 vidual members of the colony. In the connecting portion of the 
 colonial wall are no sensory cells so these nerve cells must have a 
 motor function. 

6. The sympathetic system is represented by fine nerves from 
 the aboral surface of the ganglion to the dorsal and dorso-external 
 wall of the oesophagus. Ventral fibers also join with the oral nerve 
 ring by anastomoses. 

There is a nerve network over the surface of the alimentary 
 canal. At the beginning of the oesophagus and extending to the 
 stomach there is a network of cells and fibers forming a sort of 
 nerve ring. Further down all parts of the alimentary canal have 
 a nerve plexus. The nerve net is especially abundant about the 
 rectum. The function of the sympathetic system seem,s to be 
 motor. The sympathetic system in the digestive canal consists of 
 a nerve network of ganglion cells as well as stands of nerve fibers.

Van Beneden, 1845, although he considers Pedicellina, gives 
 little or nothing on the nervous system. Kowalewsky, 1867, dis- 
 cusses the development and Uljanin, 1869, gives the position of 
 the ganglion in the same genus. Nitsche, 1875, shows the general 
 position and chief branches of Pedicellina. Salensky, 1877, gives 
 the general location of the ganglion in Loxosoma. 

Harmer, 1885, gives one of the best early accounts of the nerv- 
 ous system of Loxosoma. He describes a dumb-bell-shaped gan- 
 glion, bipolar cells on the surface and a median fibrous part. 
 Nerves pass from the ganglion to the tentacle prominences. There 
 are many sense cells in the tentacles. Silver nitrate was used 
 to determine the position of the sense cells. The ganglion is devel- 
 oped from the ectodermic floor of the vestibule and is connected 
 with a well developed system of peripheral nerves ending in sense 
 cells bearing tactile hairs on various parts of the body. The adult 
 has no supraoesophageal ganglion. The nervous system of Lox- 
 osoma develops by ectodermic invaginations ; the connection be- 
 tween the two parts is established secondarily. 

Foettinger, 1887, represents the nervous system of Pedicellina 
 by a brain more or less completely divided into two lateral lobes. 
 It is formed by a mass of ganglion cells surrounding a fibrous 
 center. From the ganglion several pairs of nerves pass. 

Seeliger, 1890, gives the development and position of the 
 nervous system in endoprocts. 

Davenport, 1893, shows the position of the ganglion in Una- 
 tella. 

Nickerson, 1901, in L. davenporti describes the brain as just 
 in front of the intestine and above the stomach, between it and the
