process passing to the periphery, the other running centrally. The 
 number, position, size and form of the cells is symmetrical in both 
 halves of the ganglion, also the processes are symmetrically dis- 
 posed. Commissural fibers bind right and left halves of the 
 ganglion. Some fibers leave the brain directly from ganglion cells 
 while others enter or leave by way of paired nerve fibers which 
 connect directly with the central fibrous core of the ganglion. 

The ganglion cells are said to be absolutely constant as to their 
 position, form and relative size. The position of the nuclei in the 
 cytoplasm is not so constant. The larger and smaller fibers seem 
 also constant in number and position. 

Sense cells are found at the surface of the body more or less 
 removed from the surface. Single sensory nerve cells with two 
 nuclei end directly in the surface. Another kind of sensory ending
