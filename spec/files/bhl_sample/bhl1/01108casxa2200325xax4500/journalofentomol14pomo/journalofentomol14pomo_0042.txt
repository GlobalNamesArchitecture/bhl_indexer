Tetraleurodes herberti, new species 

Pupa-case: — Average size 0.92 mm. by 0.64 mm.; shape sub- 
 elliptical, slightly more pointed at the caudal end ; color shining 
 black. The case is closely applied to the leaf. Dorsum keeled 
 along the median line with the raised area somewhat wider in the 
 cephalic and thoracic regions than in the abdominal region. The 
 segments are distinct with suture lines well defined, particularly 
 across the keeled area. Outlines of rudimentary legs on the 
 ventral surface plainly visible through the case. In the cephalic 
 region on both sides of the median line is a circular mark or 
 depression which is bounded by two markings arranged as arcs of 
 concentric circles. Caudad of these markings and close to the 
 median line on either side is another group of two subcircular, 
 clearly defined markings or pore-like openings, one latero-caudad 
 of the other. In the thoracic region is still another pair of tri- 
 angularly arranged groups of three irregularly outlined depres- 
 sions, a pair on each segment suture from the thoraco abdominal 
 suture to the vasiform orifice. In the cephalic and thoracic region 
 on either side of the median line is a row of about five small cir- 
 cular pores which passes just laterad of the groups of markings in 
 those regions to and including the first abdominal segment. Smaller 
 circular pores are present just caudad of the abdominal depres- 
 sions, one for each depression. A pair of similar pores are found 
 just cephalo-laterad of the anterior margin of the vasiform orifice, 
 another pair laterad and still another pair just cephalad of the 
 anterior margin of the vasiform orifice. Vasiform orifice sub- 
 ovate, surrounded by thickened integument and raised well above 
 the general level of the dorsum; operculum filling the opening.
