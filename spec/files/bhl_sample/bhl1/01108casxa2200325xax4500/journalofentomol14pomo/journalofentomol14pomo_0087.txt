DIPTERAL 

The common kelp fly, Fucellia rufitibia Stem, was particularly 
 abundant on decaying kelp along the beach during the summer. 
 In some instances the flies completely cover the masses of seaweed 
 and rise in clouds when disturbed. It would be interesting to know 
 the larval habits of this species. 

The lemur syrphid, Baccha lemur O, S., was reared in con- 
 siderable numbers from Erium lichtensioides Ckll. on California 
 sage, Artemisia californica Less., which was abundant in the 
 Laguna Beach Canyon. 

The small gray leucopis, Leucopis griseola Fall., was reared in 
 immense numbers from the leaves of muskmelon vines which were 
 severely infested with the melon aphis. Aphis gossypii Glover. The 
 small larvae and pupae were abundant on the undersides of the 
 leaves. That a large proportion of the muskmelon vines growing 
 along the ocean between Laguna Beach and San Juan Capistrano, 
 were not entirely destroyed, may be credited to the efficaceous work 
 of the larvae of this fly. I have never seen a predaceous maggot so 
 numerous. 

LEPIDOPTERA 

The Sycamore borer, Synanthedon (Aegeria) mellinipennis 
 (Bdv.).'- The work of the larvae of this moth on the trunks of 
 the Western Sycamore or plane tree, Platanus racemosa Nutt., is 
 very characteristic, consisting of numerous tunnels in the inner 
 bark and the expulsion of quantities of reddish-brown frass which 
 collects in the crevices of the bark and around the bases of the 
 trees, at once calling attention to the presence of the insect. 

The infestations occured on large trees and was confined to 
 the trunks from the ground to a distance of about six feet. Many 
 of the trees were infested with great numbers of caterpillars, but 
 no evidence of serious injury to the general health of any of the 
 infested trees was noticeable. The moths mimic in color, size and 
 flight the common yellow jacket, Vespa germanica Linn. Indeed 
 so great was the resemblance that the moths hovering about the 
 tree trunks were first thought to be yellow jackets until they 
 alighted. 

A single grove of western sycamore, comprising some fifty 
 trees, in Niguel Canyon was the only one observed to be infested by 
 this moth, although there were numerous other trees in the different 
 canyons around Laguna Beach. 

The western sycamore is apparently the native host of this 
 species, which is recorded from California and Colorado, without 
 previous host records.
