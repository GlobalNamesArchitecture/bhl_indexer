 into the basement membrane. The center is of a clear substance 
 and about this center are nerve cells. 

Harmer, 1917, in Phoronis ovalis gives the position of the 
 nerve ring which he shows thickened on the dorsal side. 

I have had some opportunity to study P. pacifica and a species 
 of PJwroyiapsis. It is quite important in studying the serial sec- 
 tions of this group that rather perfect preparations be available, a 
 condition not altogether easy, as sand often interferes with good 
 sections. However a number of perfect preparations were ob- 
 tained. 

In general I found the nervous system much as already indi- 
 cated by the many of the others. In P. pacifica I found central 
 nervous system to have its chief concentration a little below the
