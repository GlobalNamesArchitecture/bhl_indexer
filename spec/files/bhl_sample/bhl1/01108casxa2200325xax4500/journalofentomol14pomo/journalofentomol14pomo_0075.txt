X. Phoronida and Actinotrochia 

Wright in 1856 described the first species of Phoronis. Dyster, 
 1858, suggests two oesophageal ganglia. He found that the crea- 
 tures were not particularly sensitive to light. I have a reference 
 to a paper by Kowalevsky, 1861, on the anatomy and development 
 of Phoronis, but as I have not seen it or a review of it I do not know 
 how much the nervous system is considered. 

Caldwell's publication of 1883 is the next paper of importance. 
 He describes the nerve processes in connection with the ectoderm ; 
 both fibers and ganglion cells occur in the ectoderm. There are 
 concentrations of the nervous tissue about the mouth to form a 
 post-oral nerve ring; the anus is outside of this. The ring forms 
 a line along the base of the tentacles formed like a horse shoe. In 
 front of the ring is a pair of sense organs, the ciliated pits in the 
 concavity of the lophophore on either side of the anus. There is an 
 epithelium here with sense cells, ganglion cells and nerve fibers. 
 The nervous system is further continued on the left side from the 
 dorsal part as a cord or strand just outside the basement membrane. 

Mcintosh, 1888, in P. buskii describes a similar epidermal sys- 
 tem concentrated about the mouth to form a post-oral nerve ring 
 with the anus outside. The ring follows the line along the base of 
 the tentacles and to the "ciliated pits" or concavity of the lophophore 
 on either side of the anus. The nervous system has sense cells 
 and ganglion cells and nerve fibers. On the left side is a cord 
 through the body. The left longitudinal nerve tube or tubes of 
 Caldwell is not described. 

Andrews, 1890, in a new species describes the "glandular pit" 
 of the lopophore and a large "nerve rod" on the left side, solid and 
 surrounded by epidermal cells. It seems to have a fibrillated or 
 possibly only a coagulated structure. The rod extends through a 
 considerable distance and ends in a peculiar ring of epidermal nerve 
 substance about the mouth. At this region there are two symmet- 
 rically placed nerve rods but the right is short. 

Benham, 1889, finds the nervous system immediately below the 
 epidermis as Caldwell was first to observe. Passing aborally from 
 the lopophore ridge the basement membrane is seen to separate 
 from the epidermis by a narrow ground substance not readily 
 stained. In this granular substance are a few rounded nuclei be- 
 longing to small nerve cells. Fibers are also found coming from 
 the epithelial cells of the surface. This nerve band follows the 
 ridge of the lophophore rassing around on the oral side and curves 
 at the side of the nephridial ridges following the spiral course of the 
 lophophore. It always keeps along the outer edge of the tentacles. 
 From this band nerve tissue goes to each tentacle passing along its 
 inner surface. A nerve goes to each nephridium and a nerve layer 
 to the epistome, this being the only dorsal part of the nervous
