linidae. The conspicuous millepede Spirobolus marginatus 
 (Say), was also found in these situations. The soil was covered 
 with a layer of dead leaves and other vegetable detritus, but this 
 had not been sufficient to prevent the dessication of the soil to a 
 depth varying from six to twelve inches or more. Three larvae 
 taken on September 5 were placed in breeding vials. 

On September 19, 1920, Mrs. Alexander and the writer con- 
 tinued the search in these same haunts, and this resulted in the 
 discovery of six additional larvae and four teneral pupae. As 
 before, they occurred in soil that was very dry, underneath a layer 
 of leaf-mold and other debris. These were placed in rearing. 

On September 29, 1920 the writer again went to Augurville 
 Woods. The weather was very cold and raw. By careful search- 
 ing, eight pupae were discovered, some being very dark colored and 
 evidently nearly ready to transform to the adult condition. These 
 were placed in tin salve boxes for rearing. On the following day, 
 two females of Cladura flavoferruginea emerged from two of the 
 pupae discussed above. Other adults emerged during the following 
 week. The remaining larvae and pupae were preserved in alcohol. 

Bergroth and other writers had surmised the relationship of 
 Cladura to the nearly apterous snow-fly, Chionea Dalman, a fact 
 that is amply substantiated by the discovery of the larvae of the two 
 genera. Brauer, Egger and Frauenfeld (1854) had taken gravid 
 females of the commonest European species of Chionea, C. aran- 
 eoides, and confined them in breeding jars, where they laid a 
 large number of eggs, which hatched into stout yellow larvae that 
 agree in many features of their organization with the larvae of 
 Cladura described in this paper. Unfortunately the larvae of 
 Chionea have never been carried through to the pupal condition. 

The larvae of the two genera agree in their short, stout form, 
 the obliquely truncated spiracular disk that is quite devoid of sur- 
 rounding lobes, and in the general features of the head capsule. The 
 pupa of Cladura is notable by the entire lack of protuberant breath- 
 ing-horns, the breathing-pores being entirely sessile. The nearest 
 approach to this condition in the Tipulidae is found in the genus 
 Dicranoptycha Osten Sacken, which is likewise characteristic of 
 unusually dry conditions in open upland woods. Other notable 
 features of the pupa of Cladura are found in the very elongate leg- 
 sheaths and the unusual development of long setae on the dorsal 
 and pleural regions of the abdomen. The pupa is very small com- 
 pared with the adult which emerges from it. 

Natural Affinities 

The genus Cladura unquestionably belongs to the tribe Eriop- 
 terini where it was placed by Osten Sacken. The discovery of the 
 immature stages confirms the belief that this genus, as well as 
 Chionea Dalman, and probably Crypteria Bergroth and Ptero-
