Pupa-case: â€” Size 0.92 mm. by 0.53 mm.; shape elliptical; 
 color transparent white with developing adult within light yellow. 
 There is a vertical ventral fringe of closely coalesced, white, wax 
 rods extending to the leaf. This fringe may be seen adhering to 
 the leaf in the form of a ring when the case is removed. Secre- 
 tions of the dorsum are lacking. The segments of the dorsum are 
 distinct. The abdomen bears two parallel rows of irregular 
 depressions which are indistinct in some cases. Vasiform orifice 
 subsemielliptical with the cephalic margin straight. Operculum 
 subrectangular, curved laterally, the distal end truncate extending 
 one-half the length of the orifice. Lingula cylindrical extending 
 about seven-eighths of the length of the orifice, densely setose at its 
 distal end which bears a pair of small lobes and a pair of long, 
 straight setae projecting caudad. There are other setae on the

case as follows: a small, delicate pair on the cephalic margin, a 
 long pair in the cephalic region, an equally long pair on the first 
 abdominal segment, a minute pair opposite the lateral extremities 
 of the cephalic margin of the vasiform orifice, a long pair set in 
 tubercled bases just within the caudal margin and a very small 
 pair on the latero-caudal margin. The case must be handled 
 carefully in mounting to prevent breaking these setae. The sub- 
 marginal area is not set off" from the dorsum by a raised ridge or 
 depression. The margin of the case is evenly crenulated, the
