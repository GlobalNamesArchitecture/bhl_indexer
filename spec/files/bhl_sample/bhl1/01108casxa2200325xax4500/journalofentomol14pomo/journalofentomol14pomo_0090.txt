lobe of the mantle. From the anterior angle a ventral pallial nerve 
 soon branches into two, one for the dorsal lobe of the mantle and 
 one for the corresponding adductor muscles. It is probable that 
 these nerves also go to the muscles and viscera. In the ventral re- 
 gion is a plexus formed by the ventral pallial nerves. In the 
 mantle the pallial nerves form a plexus with ganglion cells. 

There are no positive organs of sense; there are neither eyes 
 nor otocysts. Probably the margins serve as organs of touch. The 
 cirri are probably for tactile sense, possibly olfactory. They have 
 a rich nerve plexus. 

Stomach papillae Joubin, 1886-92, suggested as gustatory, and 
 the terminal papillae of the mantle Sollas, 1887, believed had a 
 tactile function. 

In Ecardia, Delage and Herouard give a separate account. A 
 single pair of ganglia are situated very low and at the external
