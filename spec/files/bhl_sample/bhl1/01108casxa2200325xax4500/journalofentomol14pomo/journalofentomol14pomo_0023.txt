missuralis, on live Mytilus. Abundant. With medusae in Decem- 
 ber, 1920. 

CORYMORPHIDAE : Large, solitary hydranth with basal and 
 distal whorls of filiform tentacles. Medusae produced just within 
 basal tentacles. 

Corymorpha palma Torrey. Hyd. Pacific Coast. U. C. pub. 
 Zool. vol. 1, no. 1, p. 37. 

A very large and beautiful species found abundantly in quiet 
 pools. Solitary, rooted in sand by filamentous processes. Proximal 
 tentacles 18-30 in number. Balboa Bay, in sandy pool. Usually 
 numerous in unexposed places. 

TuBULARiiDAE : Solitary or colonial. Large, often bright 
 pink in color. Hydranths with a basal and a distal whorl of filiform 
 tentacles. Sporosacs are pendant clusters. 

Tubularia crocea (Ag.) Allman. Gym, Hyds, 1871, Dense col- 
 onies, 8-10 cms. in length. Few branches. About 20-24 basal ten- 
 tacles. On piles with other hydroids, tunicates, Crustacea and 
 mollusca. Low tide, December, 1920. Long Beach, Cal. 

Tuhularia sp. Distinguishable from above species in several 
 characters but not corresponding with any available discriptions. 
 I am not inclined to think it the T. marina of Torrey. Growing 
 with the above species at Long Beach. Rather rare. Probably the 
 same species discussed by Professor Bean in the Fourth Laguna 
 Report of Pomona College. Specimens also collected during the 
 summer of 1921, 

Sertulariidae : Colony usually branching; hydrothecae ses- 
 sile, forming a double row along opposite sides of hydrocaulus ; 
 gonangia large, few, no free medusae, 

Sertularia furcata Trask. Proc. Calif. Acad. Sc, 1854, I, p. 
 112. 

This is a very variable species but ours are typical and agree 
 with figured specimens of several authors. Gonangia were numer- 
 ous on colonies taken at Huntington Beach, April, 1921, from piles 
 under the pier. Numerous, on stalks of algae and on rope. 

Sertularia tricuspidata Hincks. Hist. Brit, Zoophytes. London, 
 1868. 

This is a very common species at Laguna Beach, growing in 
 great numbers on Fucus with other hydroids. Inshore tide zone. 
 January, 1921. With a creeping rootstock on which there are a few 
 gonangia, ripe. Hilton.
