Preliminary Notes on Growth-Stages in 

Brittle-Stars

There are a number of conditions to account for our present 
 lack of a rational system of the brittle-stars. One of the principal 
 reasons why the group is so difficult to classify lies in the profound 
 ignorance of their growth-changes. The excellent systematic 
 work of Ljungman, Lutkin, Lyman, Koehler and the two Clarks 
 have brought some thousand species to attention but the real rela- 
 tionship of these as larger groups is yet quite unsolved. There have 
 been several attempts to rationalize the classification, one by Bell, 
 1892, and more recently by Matsumoto, 1915. Neither of these sys- 
 tems is thoroughly based upon phylogenetic history, and hence, can- 
 not be conclusive since the state of our present knowledge is such 
 as to forbid any sweeping generalizations. 

Although the chief reason for our lack of a rational system in 
 the group is this lack of attention upon growth-stages, another 
 lies in the general disregard of palaeontological evidence, and a fur- 
 ther reason because attention has been focused upon larval, rather 
 than post-larval, stages. 

Material heretofore studied in connection with this problem 
 of growth-stages in the young of ophiurans numbers less than one 
 dozen species, all of which are Atlantic or West Indian forms. My 
 own observations were made upon seven species, the members of 
 five families. All are the members of the littoral fauna of Southern 
 California. Specimens were collected in all accessible habitats and 
 studied after preservation. 

The excellent plates for this paper are the work of Miss E. 
 Keyes, a student in Pomona College. 

It is not always possible to tell just whj^ one places a form in 
 this or that group for many characters are subtile and one is obliged 
 to depend very often upon general features. Especially is one 
 dependent upon as complete a series as possible in placing a juve- 
 nile. H. L. Clark, in his paper on growth-changes in some brittle- 
 stars expresses the only formulation of the very important con- 
 tribution of R. T. Jackson to the study of juvenile brittle-stars that 
 I have seen. This law is a very real help in determining possible 
 relationships between specimens otherwise obscure or impossible 
 to differentiate. Briefly stated, we may say that, as applied to 
 these forms, the base of an arm of a young form corresponds ex- 
 ceedingly suggestively with the tip of an arm of an adult specimen 
 of the same species. However, the extent of localization varies 
 greatly in different species, as I have found. One needs much 
 study to determine accurately the position of a given specimen.
