size of the radial shields is especially noticeable in a series of spec- 
 imens. One of the interesting features of this species is the great 
 range of color variation found. This is true both in young and 
 adults. 

Conclusions : 

1. A rational system in the brittle-stars is lacking. Such a 
 system may result in part at least, from a complete study of growth- 
 stages. 

2. Jackson's law of localized stages repeating phylogenetic his- 
 tory seems to be well vindicated in this and other studies. 

3. The groups examined seem to bear certain relationships to 
 each other, as indicated above.
