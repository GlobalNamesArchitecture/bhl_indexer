chionea Alexander, should be isolated from the Eriopteraria where 
 now placed and made a separate subtribe, the Chionearia or 
 Claduraria, the former name being based on the oldest genus. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE IMMATURE STAGES 

Larva — Length (fully grown), 10-10.5 mm. 

Diameter, 1.2 mm. 

General coloration light yellow throughout. 

Form comparatively short and stout. Integument provided 
 with a delicate appressed pubescence; no distinct setae. Abdomi- 
 nal segments divided into a narrow basal annulus and a much 
 broader posterior annulus, the latter being approximately two and 
 one-half times as long as the former; the ventral s;.irface of the 
 basal annuli of abdominal segments two to seven with a conspicu- 
 ous transverse area of microscopic points arranged in long trans- 
 verse rows. 

Spiracular disk entirely destitute of lobes, the spiracles being 
 located on the obliquely truncated dorso-caudal surface of the last 
 abdominal segment. Spiracles circular, the ring pale, the centers 
 dark; spiracles separated from one another by a distance about 
 equal to or a little less than the diameter of one. Ventral surface 
 of the terminal abdominal segment with a projecting, flattened 
 lobe that is provided with a dense brush of short, pale setae, th-'^ 
 organ presumably being used for propelling the insect through 
 the soil. 

Head entirely retractile. Head-capsule very compact for a 
 member of the Eriopterini. Frontal plate broad, only slightly nar- 
 rowed behind, the apex obtuse or subtruncate. LalDrum-epiphar- 
 ynx quadrate, the surface covered with short, dense hairs ; on 
 either side a stout oval arm or lobe directed cephalad, these arms 
 connected by narrow bars, with the frame-work of the head. Men- 
 tal bars entirely separate, each bar with two acute teeth on the 
 cephalic side immediately before the apex. Antennae two-seg- 
 mented, the basal segment short-cylindrical, the terminal segment 
 elongate-oval, gradually narrowed to the obtuse apex. Mandibles 
 relatively slender, of a herbivorus tyre, the teeth blunt; anical 
 point small ; two incomplete rows of flattened obtuse denticles 
 along the inner face of the mandible, the outermost tooth of each 
 row largest, the others gradually smaller, becoming subobsolescent: 
 the basal teeth are very tiny, arranged in short combs ; proximal 
 caudal angle of the mandible produced into a cylindrical chitinized 
 bar. Maxillae consisting of simple hairy lobes. 

Pupa — Length, 6.7 mm. 

Width, d.-s., 1.4 mm. 

Depth, d.-v., 1.4 mm.
