The following notes were made during the Summer Session 
 at the Pomona College Marine Laboratory, Laguna Beach and 
 vicinity during June and July, 1921. 

ORTHOPTERA^ 

Two earwigs, Anisolabis annulipes Lucas and A. maritima 
 Brun., were commonly taken in the canyons in damp places under 
 stones, logs and in wet leaves. The former occured under stones 
 close to the creeks. 

The cockroach, Arenivaga (HomologaTnia) erratica (Rehn), 
 was taken under a large stone. The specimen taken was appar- 
 ently full grown and a wingless male. A winged female was also 
 collected. 

The mantids, St agmomantis calif ornica R & H and Litaneutria 
 obscura Scudd., were both taken on the hills near the ocean beach 
 during July 1921. 

The common tree cricket in the Laguna Beach region proves 
 to be Oecanthus nigricoryiis var. argeyitinus Sauss. A number of 
 these were taken during July. 

The red Jerusalem cricket, Stenopelmatus fuscus Hald., was 
 taken in a rotten log in Niguel Canyon. The common species at 
 Laguna Beach which regularly traverses the streets at night and 
 may often be found in the morning, is S. longispina Brunner 
 (Syn. 5. irregularis Scudd.). 

The large blue-winged grasshopper, Lepriis glaucipennis 
 Scudd., proved to be a match for the most active entomologists and 
 eluded many a net. The species measures from 2 to 21/2 inches 
 long and the color matches perfectly the color of the soil on the 
 hills, back from the ocean where it occurs. The blue under-wings 
 easily characterizes it. 

THYSANOPTERA 

Western grass thrips, Frankliniella (Euthrips) occidentalis 
 (Pergande)-. A pale yellowish-brown species was abundant in 
 the heads of Juncus xiphiodes Meyer growing in fresh water at the 
 mouths of the canyons near the ocean.
