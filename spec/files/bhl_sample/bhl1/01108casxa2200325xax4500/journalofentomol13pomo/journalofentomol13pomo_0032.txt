24 NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND SENSE ORGANS 

showed a direct connection between ectoderm and entoderm, a con- 
 clusion which Parker, 1917, and Parker and Titus, 1916, have 
 shown on both anatomical and physiological evidence. 

Von Heider, 1877, was of the opinion that the mesenteries of 
 some actinians might contain nervous elements. Wolff, 1904, and 
 Kassianow, 1908, were of the opposite opinion but a number of 
 investigators seem to have shown that Von Heider's opinion is the 
 right one, among them Hickson, 1895, Ashworth, 1899, Kiikenthal 
 and Proch, 1911, and Liedermeyer, 1914. 

In recent years Parker has given this group considerable atten- 
 tion and some of his conclusions will be employed in the following 
 discussion. There is also a paper on the histology of actinians by 
 Sanchez, 1918, but in this the nervous system is not considered very 
 extensively. 

The effector systems of sea-anemone are mucous glands, ciliated 
 epithelium and muscles. Although nematocysts are considered by 
 some to be under control of the nervous system, there is good evi- 
 dence that they are independent of it. The only system under the 
 control of the nervous system is the muscular. By means of experi- 
 ments it was learned that the bases of the anemones were especially 
 sensitive, but nervous transmission may be accomplished from 
 almost any portion of the ectoderm to its longitudinal mesenteric 
 muscles. By several experiments it was proved that the trans- 
 mission might be by means of almost any narrow bridge of tissue, 
 proving quite conclusively that the transmission is by a nerve-net. 

Many muscles responded at some distance from the point stimu- 
 lated and in some cases muscles were capable of responding directly 
 to a stimulus ; whether these muscles were also under the control of 
 the nervous system at other times was not clearly established in 
 every case. In the acontia, however, there seemed to be no inter- 
 mediation of nerve impulses in the response to stimuli. Connections 
 from ectoderm to entoderm was proved in many cases. In con- 
 necting the ectodermic and entodermic system the lips and oesopha- 
 gus seemed not as important organs as other parts of the body. 

Although the system of the actinians is diffuse there is some 
 degree of specialization. If the tentacles are stimulated by a nu- 
 trient fluid the oesophagus gapes by contraction of the transverse 
 mesenteric muscles, while weak acid causes a retraction of the oral 
 disc by means of a contraction of the longitudinal mesenteric 
 muscles. The two kinds of response suggest independent receptors 
 and relatively independent transmission tracts. 

In the tentacles the ectodermal surface is more receptive than 
 the entodermal ; if there is a nervous structure in the latter it is 
 probably very simple. The tentacles are complete neuro-muscular 
 organs and may react quite independently of the polyp, as shown 
 when severed from the body.
