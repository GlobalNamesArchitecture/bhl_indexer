20 NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND SENSE ORGANS 

are often found, but the two kinds are not usually in the same ani- 
 mal. 

In Lizzia, the eye spots are found on the under side of the ten- 
 tacle, but in this foiTn the tentacle is held up and its lower side 
 turned toward the lieht. 

In Pohjorchis, Little '14, the eye spot is on the outer surface 
 at the base of each tentacle. In other naked-eye medusae, similar 
 conditions are found ; the eyes may be arranged about the margin 
 as in this form, or in groups to correspond with the groups of ten- 
 tacles. 

In genus Triopsis, there are eight marginal sense organs con- 
 sisting of an entodermal ocellus and an open fold of velum which 
 contains concretions. In Phopaloncma the lithocysts are inclosed. 

In the Narcomedusae there are marginal sensory clubs con- 
 taining concretions of entodermal origin. Romanes. '98, found that 
 if the bell of a hydroid medusa was removed the contractions of the 
 bell cease, but the margin which contains the nerve ring continues 
 to contract as before the injury. Any iniur\' of the umbrella 
 causes no change in the rhythm so long as the nerve ring is intact. 
 The conclusion from this was that the nerve ring is a coordinating 
 center and one needful for rhvthmical contractions. 

In many medusae, otocysts or senorv clubs probably function 
 as static organs. In Anthromedusae there are no otocysts, but 
 many have ectodermal ocelli on the bnses of the tentacles. Romanes 
 found that these had certain v'sual functions. Medusae with them 
 were strongly attracted to light between the red and violet spec- 
 trum. 

In some forms like Bougainvillia. the tentacles are grouped 
 and to correspond to each tentacle at its base is an ocellus or pig- 
 ment spot. 

In the Lentomedusae there may be marginal sensory clubs and 
 there may be lithocysts of ectodermic oriein. In some forms such 
 as Laodicea there mav be marginal sense clubs with no concretions 
 within and ectodermal ocelli at the b^ses of the tentacles. 

In Orchistoma pileus Larson, there are four hundred dark 
 brown entodermal ocelli on the circular canal ; each is provided with 
 an ectodermal lens. 

SCYPHOZOANS. The marginal sense organs of this groun aro 
 so marked as to be early i-ecognized. Ehrenberg. 1837, was the first 
 to speak of these as organs of sense. The usual type is somewhat 
 as follows. At eight marginal notches we find two small tentacles 
 either side of a shorter hollow tentacle. This tentacle or tentaculo- 
 rvst contains otolyths and the ore'an seems to be one of equilibrium. 
 Unon the surface of this tentaculocvst there may be a special pig- 
 ment spot or ocellus of rather simole structure. In the little flap 
 above and also behind or below the short sensory tentacle there may 
 be special areas of cells which may have some sort of olfactory or
