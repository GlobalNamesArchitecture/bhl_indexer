system. The four other muscles, the longitudinal muscles of the 
 stalk, proboscis and the two sets of the tentacles, are quicker in 
 their action and are controlled by anesthetics. These are probably 
 supplied by sense cells and the nerve-net. 

Stimuli applied to any part of the normal animal may be trans- 
 mitted to distant parts ; strong stimuli are transmitted to more dis- 
 tant parts than weak ones. The nervous transmission is probably 
 limited to the ectoderm. Although the nervous system is very 
 primitive, reactions much like a true reflex occur, as Parker has 
 pointed out. When a proximal tentacle is strongly stimulated ad- 
 jacent tentacles respond and the proboscis may turn to the stimu- 
 lated point.

Many parts of the polyp are quite independent of the rest of 
 the body, as may be seen when the hydranth has been removed ; the 
 stalk will shorten and even localize a stimulus applied to one side. 
 The hydranth is not necessary for coordinated response. Neither
