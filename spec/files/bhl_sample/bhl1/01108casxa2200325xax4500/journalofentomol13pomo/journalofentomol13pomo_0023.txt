IV. Coelenterata 

Hydrozoa Polyps. The structure of fresh water Hydra has 
 been studied with reference to the nervous system for some time. 
 One of the earlier papers was by Korotneff, '76, who recognized 
 nerve ceils. Later work was by T. J. Parker, '80, Rouget, '81, and 
 Schneider, '90. This last author determined a network of ganglion 
 cells to be present. Zoja, '90-'92, finds structures in Hydra which 
 he believes are nervous elements because they take special stains 
 and according to him have connections with the epithelial muscle 
 cells and with nematocysts. These cells are similar to the ganglion 
 cells described and figured by Schneider. 

Citron, '02, in Syncoryne a compound hydroid, finds spindle- 
 shaped sense cells especially in the end knobs of the tentacles. Gang- 
 lion cells with three or four processes are found in various parts of 
 the body while bipolar ganglion cells are found in the coenosarc. 

Wolff", '03, determined that hydroid polyps have a nervous sys- 
 tem, partly of sense cells, partly of ganglion cells. The processes of 
 the latter are more or less joined. The sense cells are primitive 
 intra-epithelial. There is quite a complex network of fibers and 
 cells on the body and tentacles, quite a concentration also on the 
 manubrium. Long strands of the plexus run the whole length of 
 the polyp. There is a less abundant entodermal plexus. 

Hadzi in '09, used the isolation method with Hi/dia, also sec- 
 tioning methods. He found a plexus of nerve cells all over the 
 surface of the lx)dy and tentacles ; these were chiefly triangular 
 shaped cells. He distinguishes bipolar and tripolar cells as well as 
 some multipolar forms ; the first are sense cells. He shows anasto- 
 moses at various places. The greater part of the system is an ecto- 
 dermic network. He says that it is not appropriate to speak of 
 neurones, for the cells are directly connected by protoplasmic proc- 
 esses, and Hydra is too far from the tjT)e in reference to which the 
 neurone concept was established. 

The palm hydroid Corymorpha, which is more favorable than 
 Hydra tor experimentation, has been studied by Torrey '04, Parker, 
 '17, and others. 

The reaction systems of coelenterates are cilia, nettle cells, 
 mucous glands and muscles. In this genus, mucous glands and cilia 
 are not important. Nettle cells are apparently independent of ner- 
 vous control, a condition not true of Hydra if we accept the work 
 of several investigators. 

There are six sets of muscles in Coryniorplia; two of these are 
 entodermic, the circular muscle of the stalk and the circular muscle 
 of the proboscis. When anesthetics which control nervous tissues 
 are used, the.se two muscles remain capable of acting. This proba- 
 blv shows that these muscles are not under control of the nervous
