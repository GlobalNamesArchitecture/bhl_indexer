Littoral Ophiurans at Laguna Beach 

ARTHUR S. CAMPBELL 

During the summer of 1920 specimens of all species of ophiurans previously 
 known to exist near Laguna were obtained. 

Several stations were found to be constant with the various species, some for 
 adults, and others for young. Several are limited to very special habitats. Two 
 are limited to but one locality each, while O. spiciilata is found abundantly in almost 
 all stations examined. For the first time O. maculosns was found inshore under 
 stones; previously this species had been known only from kelp holdfasts. 

The excellent plates for this paper are the work of Miss E. Keyes, a student 
 in Pomona College.
