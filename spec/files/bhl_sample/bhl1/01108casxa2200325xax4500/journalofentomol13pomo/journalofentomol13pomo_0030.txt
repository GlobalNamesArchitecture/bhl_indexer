22 NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND SENSE ORGANS 

that although the muscle of the jellyfish is capable of direct stimu- 
 lation, it is not so sensitive as the nerve-net. Parker summarizes 
 the susceptibility to stimulation as follows: 1. Marginal bodies 
 most sensitive. 2. Nerve-net. 3. Muscles directly stimulated least 
 sensitive. 

Mayer, 1917, concludes from his experiments with Cassiopea, 
 that nerve conduction is due to a chemical reaction involving the 
 cations of sodium, calcium and potassium. The probable high tem- 
 perature coefficient of ionization of this proteid may account in some 
 measure for the high tention coefficient of the rate of nerve condi- 
 tion, which he finds is two and five-tenths as great as that of the 
 electrical conductivity of the seawater surrounding the nerve. His 
 observations do not support the "local action" theory. The rate of 
 nerve conduction is practically identical whether sea water is diluted 
 with 0.415 molecular mercuric chloride or with distilled water. 

Corry, 1917, working with the same species found that regener- 
 ation takes place more rapidly on the half of the jellyfish in which 
 the sense organs were not removed. When sense organs are i"e- 
 moved and one half stimulated by electricity and the other insulated 
 half not stimulated, regeneration is more rapid on the activated 
 part. The experiments show that the rate of regeneration is but 
 one expression of the general metabolic activity of the animal and 
 as such is subject to the influence of the nerve centers as are many 
 other functional activities. It is concluded as a result of experi- 
 ments that some chemical interchange between sense organs and 
 the surrounding tissue is necessary in order that the activity of 
 these structures shall be maintained at the highest state of efficiency. 

Some sort of trophic influence is exerted in general metabolic 
 activities by the sense-organs. The structure of the nervous system 
 of this form makes it impossible to prove the existence of tropic- 
 nerve fibers as distinct from those of sensory or motor functions. 

In Pelagia, Krasinska finds large and small ganglion cells in 
 association with sense cells. The large ganglion cells are considered 
 to have a motor and the smaller ones a sensory function. There 
 are three methods of connecting the nerve plexus with the epithelial 
 surface. (1) Through peripheral processes of the ganglion cells. 
 (2) Through sense cells. (3) Through free nerve endings. No 
 direct proof of the enervation of the muscle fibers was established. 

The tentacles have large and small ganglion cells, the cells are 
 deep in the muscular folds but in the outer epithelium is a fine 
 nerve-fibrillar area. Similar fiber masses are found in other parts 
 of the body and the nervous system ; these may correspond to a 
 "neuropile." Fibrillae were found especially in the branches of 
 the ganglion cells.
