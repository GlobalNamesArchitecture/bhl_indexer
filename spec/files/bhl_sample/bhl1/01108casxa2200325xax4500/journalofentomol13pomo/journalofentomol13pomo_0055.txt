habits and experiences of the animal. Headless forms respond to 
 light but less quickly. As a rule if the head and eyes of a planarian 
 are removed the headless portion reacts as before but much more 
 slowly. In marine flatworms where the ganglia are more concen- 
 trated in the head region and where there are fewer ganglion ceils 
 along the lateral cords, the activities of the headless worms are 
 much less perfect than in planarian worms of fresh water. 

In the flatworms special cells of the ectoderm give rise to the 
 head ganglia. Later stages, or the development of the peipheral 
 system have been but little studied.

Kepner and Rich, 1918, have studied the reactions of the pro- 
 boscis of flatworms. In accordance with Monti, '97, and Steiner, 
 '98, they found that the ventral nerves are ganglionic and these 
 centers exercise control over the posterior parts of the body. The 
 middle branch from each of these ventral nerve trunks leaves the 
 ganglion that lies neare.st the base of the proboscis and from here 
 enters it. When the proboscis is removed from the animal it 
 undergoes autoamputation. Without the control of the adjacent
