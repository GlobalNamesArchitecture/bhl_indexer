42 NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SENSE ORGANS 

ning through the body, especially two thick ones. Moniez, 1881, 
 found the commissures in the forward end of the body. 

Lang, 1879-82, figures and describes the nervous system of a 
 member of the Cestoda where he finds a concentration in the scolex 
 region and nerves running from this center to the appendages in 
 this region when present and also long nerves which run the length 
 of the body. 

Roboz, 1882, shows the central ganglion and an extensive nerve 
 network in cestodes. Some authors claim to have seen ganglion cells 
 along the nerve strands and in fact Kahne considers the chief longi- 
 tudinal strands as central organs. 

Haman, 1885, also describes the long nerve fibers as having 
 ganglion cells on them. 

Niemeic, 1886, in Lignla shows a central ganglionic mass with 
 two thick strands leading from it and four or more smaller ones, 
 some of which branch again. Blanchard found similar conditions. 

In Schlistocephalua. Moniez gives a brief description of the 
 nervous system also Niemiec, 1886. 

In Bothriocephalns, Niemiec gives some indications of commis- 
 sures in the scolex region. 

In Taenia, Blanchard gives some indication and Moniez dis- 
 tinguishes a nerve ring in the tip of the scolex. Blumberg, 1877, 
 finds a larger number of longitudinal nerves than the last author 
 and Nitsche finds ten strands from the neck region of Taenia. 

Niemiec, 1886, finds a nerve ring in the rostellum and eight 
 nerves coming from the ring. As each one leaves there is a 
 swelling on the ring with small ganglion cells. A commissure sur- 
 rounds the central ganglion. Other commissures were also found 
 in this region. 

In Acanthohi,tli)ini)i Pintner, 1881, was one of the first to de- 
 scribe the nervous system. Niemiec shows it with branches to the 
 forward region, a ring commissure below the main ganglion and 
 with two thick and other thinner longitudinal strands. 

In TetrarhyiicJiiiti Lang, '82, was one of the early students. 
 Figure 11-L, is from another species which resembles the condition 
 in TetrarhynchuK. 

The nerve cells of Cestoda diff'er greatly in size. Niemiec gives 
 figures from the cells and nuclei of a number of species. He finds 
 them to be from 12x16 microns to 28x34 microns cell body; 
 nucleus, 5x8 microns to 9 x 13 microns. 

Among the more recent literature is the work of Tower, 1900, 
 on Moniezia. The complicated nervous sy.stem of this species is 
 shown in Fig. 11, A.
