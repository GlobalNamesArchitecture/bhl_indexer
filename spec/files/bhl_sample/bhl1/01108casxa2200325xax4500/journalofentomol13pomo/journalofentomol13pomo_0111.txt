Ward, 1892, on Nectonema, a pelagic marine form, gives an 
 account of the nervous system. The anterior ganglionic mass or 
 brain forms a large portion of the floor of the anterior chamber. 
 The oesophagus lies in a groove in its center. There is but a slight 
 dorsal commissure above the oesophagus. The ganglion cells are 
 not abundant in the brain. A smaller kind is more abundant than 
 another sort which is very much larger. There are five pairs of 
 these last which are nearly constant in position and form. The 
 ventral nerve cord continues from the brain and runs the length of 
 the body separated into three areas to correspond to the three nerves 
 of which it is composed. Some large cells in the cord are much like 
 those in the brain. In the male the ventral cord is much enlarged, 
 being larger than the brain itself. In the female the anal ganglion 
 is but slightly larger than the central cord with which it is 
 connected. 

Camerano, 1897, considers the nervous system to consist of a 
 supraoesophegeal ganglion and a ventral nerve strand. Mont- 
 gomery, 1903, finds a ventral unpaired nei've trunk with the cephalic 
 ganglion at its anterior enlargement and the caudal or cloacal 
 ganglion, a posterior enlargement. To the peripheral nervous 
 system belong the neural lamella; the endings in the hypodermis of 
 the fibers of nerve cells situated in the central nervous system ; the 
 hypodermal longitudinal nerve; sensory cells in hypodermis; non- 
 sensory hypodermal nerve cells and the nerve fibers which innervate 
 the cloaca of the female and the vasa defi"erentia of the male. Two 
 types of cells were found in the nerve cord. One type contained but 
 little chromatin. These cells on the lateral sides of the cord are 
 quite uniform and small. On the ventral side there are smaller and 
 larger cells of this type. The larger or giant cells are less numer- 
 ous. Sometimes there is a paired arrangement of these cells but 
 usually they are irregularly placed one behind another. These 
 cells seem to be bipolar with two large processes proceeding from 
 the cell directed towards the fibrous core of the nerve cord. Some 
 of the small cells appear to be bipolar or multipolar. All cells are 
 without membranes. Montgomery thinks that these deeply staining 
 cells are probably motor and visceral in function. 

The deeply staining cells seem to be multipolar with very long 
 nrocesses. It could not be determined whether there was anas- 
 tomosis of the processes. These cells seem like the multipolar 
 neuroglia cells of other invertebrates but processes pass into the 
 hypodermis. 

The ventral cord seems to be made up of three converging rays 
 of fibers but each lateral ray is made up of several distinct fiber 
 tracts. The median tract is the largest and is made up of longi- 
 tudinal fibers which are closely arranged. Very rarely are nerve
