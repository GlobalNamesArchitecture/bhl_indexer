a cephalic commissure. With this are associated twenty nerve cells 
 on each lateral half and a large number just anterior to it. From 
 these last groups six slender nerves pass forward close to the oeso- 
 phagus to supply the anterior region. The two sub-ventral have 
 small ganglia upon them. Connected with the caudal edge of the 
 nerve ring are four chief ganglia, one dorsal, one ventral and two 
 lateral. Each of these has long strands extending towards the tail

end of the animal. Continued from the ventral and separated a 
 little distance is another ventral ganglion, the post-ventral. The 
 dorsal cephalic ganglion is the smallest; the lateral cephalic ganglia 
 are the largest. As pointed out by others the cephalic commissure 
 or nerve ring is essentially fibrous. The fibers are derived from the 
 ganglia connected with it.
