is the stalk necessary for reflex movements of the tentacles and the 
 proboscis. 

The neuro-muscular organization of Corymorpha is diffuse and 
 in no sense centralized. 

Hydroid Medusae. Although the nervous system of medusae 
 is of the diffuse type, there are concentrations of the network at 
 certain places. In Gonionemns there is a double ring of nerve cells 
 and fibers about the margin of the bell. Hyde, '02, mentions a third 
 ill-defined ring; this might be considered to be a part of the diff'use 
 network or plexus which is found over the surface of the sub- 
 umbrella. In addition to the two main marginal bands, there are 
 concentrations of nerve cells and fibers following the four radii of 
 the bell, and the manubrium has some concentration of nerve cells 
 and fibers. 

Although the nerve ring is usually double, sometimes it is not 
 divided. The nerve tissue is between the ectoderm and the muscu- 
 lar tissue. In some forms the peripheral system is but poorly de- 
 veloped with only a few nerve cells scattered beneath the surface.
