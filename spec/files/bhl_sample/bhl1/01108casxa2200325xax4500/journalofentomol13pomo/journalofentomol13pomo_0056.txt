38 NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SENSE ORGANS 

ganglia the proboscis in this way acts as a reflex organism. The 
 freed proboscis is able to carry out the three usual coordinated 
 muscular movements when the muscles are intact. The free pro- 
 boscis cannot determine food from other substances. The central 
 nervous system is necessary for this. 

The eyes of turbellarians have been extensively studied by 
 Hesse, '96. In tricladids they consist of visual cells and pigment 
 or acsessory cells. These last inclose the enlarged ends of the 
 visual cells, the rhabdomes. The number of visual cells or retinulse 
 as well as the accessory or pigment cells differs greatly. Kepner 
 and Taliaferro, '16, found the retinulse to consist of three regions; 
 a lateral nucleus bearing region closely applied to the brain with 
 a nerve fiber extending into it, a middle region lens shaped, homo- 
 geneous and highly refractive, and the true rhabdome in the pig- 
 ment cup. Kepner and Foshee, '17, compare the three regions 
 of the retinula with the rods and cones of vertebrates. The parts 
 show a close analogy if not homology with the myoid, ellipsoid and 
 rhabdome. The retinulse of both flatworms and vertebrates are 
 also of the inverted type. Taliaferro, 1920, has an important paper 
 on the reactions of Planaria to light. The species considered was 
 negative to light and turned itself accurately to horizontal rays. 
 In some cases the reactions were direct, they turned away at once 
 without preliminary movements. Specimens with both eyes re- 
 moved do not react exactly as normal individuals, but they do 
 move in general away from light. The rate of locomotion in these 
 is not appreciably affected, but the removal of the anterior end 
 greatly retards the rate of locomotion. Specimens with one eye 
 removed orient themselves accurately to light when illuminated 
 on the normal side, but do not when stimulated in this way on 
 the blind side. 

According to Taliaferro, light must strike a given rhabdome 
 parallel with its longitudinal axis in order to cause stimulation. 
 'Thus, the position of the longitudinal axis of the rhabdome re- 
 sults in a localization of photic stimulation." It is possible, accord- 
 ing to this investigator, to explain the localization of photic stim- 
 ulation in one of two ways. First, the refractive central region of 
 the retinula acts as a sort of lens to concentrate the light on the 
 sensitive rhabdome. Second, by assuming a certain structure of 
 the rhabdome coupled with a shading action of the pigment-cup. 
 Hesse, '97, ascribes the localization of the stimulus entirely to the 
 pigment-cup. 

Trematoda. In monogenetic forms such as Tristonnnu Lang, 
 1881, or Epidella, Heath, 1902, the brain consists of a rather short, 
 semicircular band near the dorsal surface just in front of the 
 pharynx. From it six longitudinal nerves arise, four ventral and 
 two dorsal. These extend the length of the body and end in the iios- 
 terior sucker. Many small nerves spring from the brain and the six
