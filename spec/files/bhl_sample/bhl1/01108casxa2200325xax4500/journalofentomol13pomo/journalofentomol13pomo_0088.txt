NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SENSE ORGANS 

lateral cords they increase in number posteriorly and are more 
 abundant on the dorsal side. In each lateral cord both dorsally and 
 ventrally are radial clusters of medium sized cells showing a bi- 
 lateral arrangement. 

Haller, 1889, shows a neuroglia network in Ccrcl>iafnliif< and 
 an anastomosis between the branches of multipolar ganglion cells. 

The nemertineans are divided into groups somewhat by the 
 position of the nervous system in relation to the body-wall. The 
 more primitive condition seems to be when the brain and chief 
 branches are outside the muscle layers, in the epithelium or belo^^■ 
 the basement membrane. In some the nervous system is found 
 in the muscle layers of the body-wall and in others the brain and 
 chief nerves lie in the parenchyma internal to the muscle layers.
