V. Flatworms 

TURBELLARIA. Among the turbellarian flatworms those of the 
 Rhobdocoelida are the simplest. Bohming, 1890, describes and 
 figures a number of central nervous systems from Alloeocoela such 
 as shown in Fig. 8. The ganglia are somewhat concentrated but 
 show right and left halves. Two or four pigment spots imbedded in 
 the brain substance may show but little indication of differentiation 
 into eyes. 

Among the Acoela some have simple pigment spots for eyes 
 and some are without them. Statocysts are found in the center of 
 the ganglionic masses in some cases. Very often a well-marked 
 statocyst or otocyst may be seen in the center of the upper portion 
 of the animal, just between the pigment spots when they are pres- 
 ent. The brain is not very extensive in Acoela. It is usually recog- 
 nized as a small mass of cells surrounding the central statocyst. 
 Lohner in Polychoerus gives about as complete account of the 
 nervous system as any. There is a central ganglion with a central 
 otocyst. Laterally there are two ganglia of nearly equal size. These 
 ganglia in cross section are nearly central in position while the 
 peripheral nervous system consists of longitudinal strands both 
 dorsal, ventral and lateral in position. Figure 8 shows the plan of 
 the nervous system as a whole. 

De Quatrefages, 1884, and Peebles, 1915, and otheivs give some 
 indications of the nervous system and sense organs of these worms, 
 but not much in detail. 

Many investigators have dealt with the Rhabdocoela. The 
 brain is a little more complex than that of the other groups men- 
 tioned but the whole system is compact and there are few longi- 
 tudinal cords from the brain region. 

Some forms have from two to four simple eyes imbedded in the 
 brain. Sensory pits near the head end are found connected with 
 the brain in some. Ott, '92, describes "dish-shaped" organs near 
 the dorsal surface of the body of Stenostoma. In this form the 
 ciliated pits are imbedded in the forward portions of the brain. In 
 other forms, they seem to be entirely separate. 

Schneider, '73, finds the lobes of the brain connected by a 
 double commissure which surrounds the vascular system. Hallez, 
 '79, Ott, '92. and others find but a single commissure. 

The fibrous portion of the brain or "punkt substance" is com- 
 posed of a fine network of fibers which some have thought was 
 made up of anastomosing processes, but the evidence is not clear. 
 Nansen, '87, does not believe in an anastomosis. 

Some of the figures from the nervous systems of this group 
 show few branches. Probably more branches were present although 
 not recognized in every case by the investigators.
