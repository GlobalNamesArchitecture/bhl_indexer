mouth. From the large ventral ganglion many branches run to 
 lateral and caudal regions of the body. This ventral ganglion is the 
 chief one from the standpoint of size. 

Many papillae on the surface of the body probably serve as 
 organs of touch. The eyes, one on each side of the dorsal region 
 of the head are globular and each contains three biconvex lenses 
 separated by pigment and surrounded by rod-like sensory cells. 
 About the dorsal part of the head end there is a ring-like ridge 
 bearing modified ciliated cells. This has been called the olfactory 
 ring.

 the position of the origin of the two chief ganglia and the lateral 
 sense organs. All are indicated by the darker shaded areas. The

the elongated larva forms the brain. This is added to on each side 
 by two lateral ridges which later unite to form the cephalic hood. 
 The ventral ganglion begins as a thickening of the ectoderm from 
 behind the head about two-thirds of the length of the body. A tac- 
 tile organ is developed from ectoderm on each side of the tail region
