Ophiuroidea of the West Coast of 
 North America 

ARTHUR S. CAMPBELL. 

This list represents those Ophiuroidea reported upon by H. L. I'lark, J. F. Mc- 
 Clendon, and others, at various times from the West Coast of North America, and 
 especially from the coast of California. Specimens listed are mostly from deeper 
 water; but a few are littoral. 

Original references to each species are given as far as possible- Bathymetrical 
 ranges given are either extremes or are the only point from which specimens are 
 known. 

There seem to be several restricted faunas represented in the list. It is quite 
 possible that specimens of almost any of the list might be taken at other points off 
 the coast, and thus extend, the known range. 

The purpose of the list is to clear up certain synonyms, to check the present 
 literature so far as possible, to record more complete data concerning the distribution 
 of forms likely to be taken nearby, and to know more thoroughly what we have. 

Our work is by no means finished, but we feel the list may be of some aid to 
 those undertaking the study of west coast forms.
