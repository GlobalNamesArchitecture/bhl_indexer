ectodermal cup. The cell within the cup enlarges and becomes the 
 lens. The lens is in this way derived from the nerve center. 

In Cercariaenum Bettendorf, 1897, shows six longitudinal 
 strands from the brain, with many branches to the pharynx and the 
 suckers. A complex nerve plexus of nerve fibers and nerve cells is 
 found over much of the body. Especially are bipolar sense cells 
 found in the pharynx. Similar bipolar sen.se cells are demonstrated 
 by Havet, 1900, by the Golgi method.

The sketch at the top is from a section across a young flatworm 
 showing the brain as a dark mass in the left side. The figure at the

mass of central nervous system in the caudal end of the animal. 
 The suckers or other appendages of the scolex region are supplied 
 with special branches. In some forms there is a definite ring of 
 fibers. In all two larger and usually four smaller longitudinal 
 strands run the length of the animal. 

Blanchard, 1847, dissected the nervous system in Ligida where 
 he found a mass of nervous tis.sue in the scolex with strands run-
