26 NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND SENSE ORGANS 

nervous system was by Hertwig, 1880. A subepithelial nerve plexus 
 with the bipolar and multipolar cells has been described and figured. 
 Bethe, '95, also describes and figures a network of nerve cells and 
 fibers in ctenophores. 

The characteristic aboral sense organ was first described by 
 Edwards, 1841. At a later time Chun, 1878, describes and figures 
 it in detail showing the little otocyst with its group of calcium 
 crystals supported on four bands of fused cilia like a little table, 
 with each tip of the leg coming into relation with two of the eight 
 ciliary bands. 

This peculiar balancing organ has been considered in a way to 
 represent a central nervous system because of its reaction to the 
 ciliary bands. These bands seem not to be under the control of the 
 nerve cells and fibers, but some are of this opinion. The nervous 
 system then would not relate to the cilia, but in some way there 
 is a coordination of movement in the eight ciliary bands. That this 
 is not as simple as might at first seem is shown by the fact that the 
 efli'ective stroke is in the opposite direction from the wave of ciliary 
 action, so that the simple explanation of the movement of one cilium 
 aflfecting the next, like a row of tenpins, does not hold. 

Bauer, 1910, found by gently touching the mouth region of a 
 ctenophore, that it stopped its cilia. If vigorously stimulated 
 its plates vibrate more actively for a short time. If the aboral 
 sense organ be removed the same reactions apply as before. He 
 concludes from this that the reactions cannot be ascribed to the 
 sense body but must depend upon the action of the diffuse nervous 
 system which although chiefly concerned with the muscles of the 
 cetenophore seems also to have an influence on the rows of swim- 
 ming plates. 

Gothlin in a recent paper, 1920, on the study of ciliary move- 
 ments finds that the primary inhibition of the ciliary movement 
 is probably due to cilio-inhibitory nerves. Receptors at the surface 
 of the body transfer their impulses to the nerve-net. These in turn 
 transmit them to the end apparatuses which inhibit the vibrations 
 of the swimming plates, probably blocking the neuroid conduction 
 between them. There is an intimate connection between primary 
 and secondary inhibitory mechanisms. Both probably use the same 
 receptors, but the primary mechanism functions on impulses of 
 weaker intensity. 

Abbott, 1904, who has studied the interesting worm-like Coelo- 
 plana has found a rudimentary nervous system with four ganglia 
 symmetrically disposed about the otolithic capsule. Just outside 
 the otolithic capsule in the angles formed by the intersecting tenta- 
 cular and .sagittal planes are four large nerve ganglia that send off 
 fibers to form a sort of diffuse peripheral system and supply fibers 
 that cover part of the capsule as an enveloping sheath. Each gang-
