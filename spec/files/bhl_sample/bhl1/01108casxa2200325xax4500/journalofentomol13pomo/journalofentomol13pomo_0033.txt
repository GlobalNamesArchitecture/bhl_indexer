Parker has measured the rate of transmission of the nerve 
 impulse in sea-anemones at 21 centigrade. It was found to be 
 from 121-146 mm. a second. 

Kassianow, Parker and others have studied the nervous system 
 and reactions of colonial forms. There seems to be little evidence 
 of any nervous coordination in colonial polj'p.s, each polyp in Renilla 
 for instance when stimulated by contact seems to react independ- 
 ently of the rest. Although the common flesh which supports them 
 may bring about like changes in several or all of the members of 
 the colony, the zooids are not centers from which impulses pass to 
 other parts. 

The peduncle and rachis are probably permeated by a nerve- 
 net which extends from the zooids of the colony. 

Ctenophora. The first observations on the nervous system 
 of this group were by Pschschiltz, 1829, and later by Mertens, 1833.
