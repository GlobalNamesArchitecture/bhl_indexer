longitudinal cords. A short distance from the brain the anterior 
 nerves are united into a curved ganglion and from this a number of 
 branches run to the anterior end of the body. On the mid-dorsal 
 line a small median nerve in Epidella runs towards the head and 
 towards the sucker, but was not found farther than this. 

In the main nerve strands and ganglionic areas bipolar cells 
 are of frequent occurrence and generally one branch from each 
 might be traced close to the surface of the body while the other 
 fiber passes into the brain. In a few cases the fibers pass to the 
 opposite side of the ganglion or brain before they terminate. Cells 
 with three branches in Epidella were found with one process to the

In Epidella, the large mass of nerve fibers and the more numer- 
 ous longitudinal bands on the ventral side are explained by the 
 fact that this side rests against the host. 

There are four eyes in Epidella. In other forms they seem not
