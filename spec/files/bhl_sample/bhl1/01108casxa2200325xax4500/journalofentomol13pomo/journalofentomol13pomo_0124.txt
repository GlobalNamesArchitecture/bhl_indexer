This journal is especially offered in exchange for zoological 
 and entomological journals, proceedings, transactions, reports 
 of societies, museums, laboratories and expeditions. 

The pages of the journal are especially open to western ento- 
 mologists and zoologists. Notes and papers relating to western 
 and Californian forms and conditions are particularly desired, 
 but short morphological, systematic or economic studies from 
 any locality will be considered for publication. 

Manuscripts submitted should be typewritten on one side of 
 paper about 8 by 11 inches. Foot notes, tables, explanations of 
 figures, etc., should be written on separate sheets. Foot notes 
 and figures should be numbered consecutively throughout. The 
 desired position of foot notes and figures should be clearly 
 indicated in the manuscript. 

Figures should be drawn so that they may be reproduced as 
 line cuts so far as possible. An unusually large number of half 
 tones must be paid for in part by the author. Other more 
 expensive illustrations will be furnished at cost. Figures for 
 cuts should be made to conform to the size of the page when 
 reduced, that is, 5 by 71/0 inches or less. The lettering should 
 be by means of printed numbers and letters pasted on the 
 drawings, in most cases. 

Authors of articles longer than a thousand words will receive 
 fifty reprints of their publications free of cost. If more than 
 this are desired, the order should be given with the return of 
 the proof sheets. Extra copies and special covers or special 
 paper will be furnished at cost. Authors of short contributions 
 will receive a few extra copies of the number containing their 
 articles. 

Manuscripts should be sent by express or registered mail.
