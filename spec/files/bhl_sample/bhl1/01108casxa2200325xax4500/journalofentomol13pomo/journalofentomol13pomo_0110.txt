NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND SENSE ORGANS 

In the female the central anal ganglion is the largest. It con- 
 nects with smaller lumbar ganglia out laterally and by a loop with 
 the rectal ganglion. 

In the male the anal ganglion is large, but the two lumbar are 
 nearly as large. Two rings of nerves are connected with the anal 
 ganglion and one with the small cloacal, and the other with the 
 rectal ganglion. 

GORDIODEA. Villott, 1874, shows that the ventral cord repre-

 siders that there is no cerebral ganglion and no ganglion cells on 
 the dorsal side of the peripharyngeal ganglion. He distinguishes 
 neuroglia cells.
