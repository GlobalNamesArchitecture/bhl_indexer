40 NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SENSE ORGANS 

always as well developed and may not always be functional. In 
 this form the eyes appear as four small pigment spots partly im- 
 bedded in the dorsal surface of the brain. In this and in Tris- 
 tomum, each eye-spot consists of an almost spherical, highly refrac- 
 tive transparent body which in many cases contains one or two 
 small vacuoles, but a nucleus was not seen. The lens is partly 
 covered by a cup of dark brown pigment granules. These parts are 
 imbedded in a rather large ganglion cell. Two or three fibers arise 
 from each ganglion cell and extend some distance into the brain. 
 A series of delicate muscles are near the eyes and their contractions 
 bring about rotations of the eyes. One pair of eyes has been found 
 to move simultaneously with the other, although this does not always 
 take place. If the animals are vigorous the movements of the eyes 
 may take place with the rapidity of a heart beat. 

The eyes are situated on the dorsal side of the brain. The 
 tissue between them and the ventral side is clear and light passing 
 under the host must strike the lens and affect the retina as the 
 pigment is placed in the most favorable position in the anterior side 
 of the lens. 

In some digenetic trematodes the nei'vous system has a rather 
 complicated system of branching as shown in Amphistomum by 
 Loss, 1892. Nerve tracts are clearly defined and nerve cells, 
 although chiefly centered in the broad brain, are also found out 
 along the peripheral nerves. 

Faust, 1918, has studied the eyes in digenetic trematodes. In 
 twenty-eight species, seven possess pigmented eyes and four non- 
 pigmented ones. Binoculate species usually have the eye spots in 
 direct connection with the posterior dorsal nerve trunks. In one at 
 least connections were with the anterior dorsal rami. The central 
 eye of trioculate species is fused to the anterior dorsal nerve trunk 
 by a blunt fiber from below. The eye spots consist of a cluster of 
 rather dark-brown granules forming a deep cup. Within the cup 
 is a spherical body barely touching the pigment granules. This is 
 the enlarged nerve ending with a nucleus within. 

The development of the eyes in Cercaria gigas is as follows : 

A branch of the posterior dorsal nerve with a single nucleus 
 pushes out from the nerve center to the dorsal margin of the 
 embryo. As it reaches a position near the surface, the ectodermal 
 layer of the embryo pushes inwards just posterior to the nerve, so 
 that a pocket is formed with the opening opposed to the nerve cell. 
 The end of the nerve fiber enlarges and twists about the inner wall 
 of the pocket so that the end with the nucleus comes to lie within 
 the cup. At first the ectodermal cells are evident, but later they dis- 
 appear. Pigment granules are not present until the nerve ending 
 comes to occupy its position within the pocket. Golden-brown pig- 
 ment granules come to be formed between the nerve endings and the
