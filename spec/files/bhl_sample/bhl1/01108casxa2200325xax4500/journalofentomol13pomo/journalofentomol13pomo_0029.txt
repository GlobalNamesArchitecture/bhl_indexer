chemical sense. Both Eimer and Romanes published physiological 
 papers in 1877-1878 on work done several years previously which 
 seemed to show that jellyfishes had the power of conducting im- 
 pulses in a complex manner along their subumbrellar surfaces. 

Taschenberg, 1877, was unable to find nervous structures and 
 considered that the muscles I'esponded directly to stimuli without 
 the aid of a nervous system. The Hertwig brothers, 1878, clearly 
 demonstrated the existence of a nervous system in medusae. 
 Schafer, '79, found a network of nerve fibers in the subumbrella 
 lying between the muscular layer and the ectoderm, but did not de- 
 termine anastomosis. Somewhat later Schlater, 1891, believed he 
 had found the true nervous system in the marginal sense organs, 
 but a clear recognition of nerve cells was again made by Kassianow 
 ten years later. He found a nerve plexus in Liicernaria and Cra- 
 tevoloplms. In the latter, tripolar ganglion cells are also found. 
 He shows sense cells and ganglion cells in direct association with 
 epithelial cells. 

Hesse, '95, in Rhizostoma shows the structure of marginal sense 
 organs in some detail and gives some indication of the nervous sys- 
 tem. Fibers run fi'om the eight marginal sense areas to a more or 
 less circular band which is somewhat poorly defined, and other 
 strands spread out over the subumbrellar muscular bands of the 
 jellyfish. The relation between cells was not clearly shown. 

Bethe, '09, was able to prove that the nerve plexus in Rhizo- 
 stoma is a true network. 

Romanes and others have shown that the bell of a jellyfish 
 could be cut in a most complex manner without preventing the pas- 
 sage of a stimulus for a contraction wave. 

If a single marginal body is stimulated, contraction waves 
 start both to the right and to the left of the stimulation until they 
 mingle and disappear. 

If the center of the jellyfish is cut out and the margin deeply 
 notched, the tortuous pathway of tissues thus formed is capable of 
 carrying a contraction wave. If a jellyfish with one marginal sense 
 organ is cut in a spiral strip, a wave of contraction may be started 
 at the margin which will run the whole length of the strip. 

A jellyfish cut so as to make two concentric rings with only 
 two slight connections between will carry the impulse from the outer 
 to the inner portion by this narrow bridge. If the jellyfish is cut 
 so as to form a long circular stretch, a wave may course for a long 
 period round and round the bell. Such a "trapped" wave has been 
 known to go for eleven days with no great decline in rate; or at the 
 rate at which it was traveling, it would have covered a distance of 
 four hundred and fifty-seven miles in eleven days, Parker, 1919. 

The removal of the marginal bodies of a medusa causes the 
 movements to cease for a time, but it may be made to contract by 
 electrical or chemical stimulus. Experiments by Bethe seem to show
