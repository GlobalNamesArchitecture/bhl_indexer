36 NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SENSE ORGANS 

The brain consists of a rather broad flat mass of nerve fibers 
 and cells occupying quite a large part of the forward portion of 
 the head end. Many nerves run out to the surface of the body and 
 two chief longitudinal strands run the length of the body. Usuallv 
 a number of commissures connects the two parts of the brain as well 
 as the two longitudinal strands. The number of these is somewhat 
 variable in the diff"erent species and also in members of the same 
 species. In some forms at least, terminal fibers connect peripheral 
 branches at the margin of the body. Fig. 9, A, D, E. Usually two 
 eyes are found connected with the brain by short nerves, but in some 
 cases at least, such as in Sorocelis, as described in Seidl, 1911, there 
 are neurone eyes scattered over the anterior region of the forward 
 end. 

Lateral extensions of the head end are often especially sensitive 
 and provided with abundant nerve cells. The eyes, simple or com- 
 plex have been well described and figured by Hesse, 1896. A sen- 
 sory cell or cells with expanded ends terminate in a pigment cup 
 which aids in centering the light on the protoplasmic ends of the 
 sense cells. Fig. 9 F-H. 

Very little has been done in analyzing the motor and sensory 
 components of the brain and nerves. Branches to the eyes and to 
 the surface of the body, especially the forward end of the body, are 
 undoubtedly sensory in nature. The brain has been divided by 
 some into an anterior and superior sensory region and a posterior 
 and inferior motor portion. Soine of the chief w-orks on this group 
 are by Chichkoff , '92 ; lijoma, '84 ; Lang, '81 ; Woodworth, '91 ; 
 Wheeler, '94; Veidovskv, '95; Hesse, '97; Micoletzky, 1907; Weiss, 
 1910; Seidl, 1911. 

Rina Monti, 1896, has studied the nerve terminations in the 
 skin of fresh-water planarians. 

The Polycladida are usually considered as having a more com- 
 plex nervous s.vstem than the tricladids, but it is more concentrated. 
 As a rule there is a number of simple eyes scattered over the for- 
 ward end of the body such as shown by De Quatrefages, 1844, 
 although in Plauocera Lang, '82, shows rather concentrated eye 
 areas. In Leptoplana, the eye spots are scattered about in the 
 region of the nervous system, as shown by Schmidt as early as 
 1862. 

Although locomotion in planarian worms may in part be by the 
 surface cilia, the chief activities seem to be by means of muscles 
 of the body under the control of the nervous system. Weak chemical 
 or tactile stimuli cause them to react positively. The resting worm 
 responds less readily than the moving one. Some forms with much 
 more hierhly organized eyes react less well than others with simnler 
 eye spots. As a rule strength of light is less important in reactions 
 than the number of sensory elements in the eye, or the former
