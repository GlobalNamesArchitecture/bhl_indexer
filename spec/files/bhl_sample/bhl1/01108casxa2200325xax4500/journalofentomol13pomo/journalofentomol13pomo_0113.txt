hypodermis some run longitudinally in the hypodermal nerve or 
 along the sides of the body. 

There are two main types of sensory cells in the hypodermis, 
 small irregular cells staining deeply and the elongated cuticular 
 cells of the raid-ventral line. Motor cells are considered to be the 
 clearer ones of the nervous system, the darker straining cells the 
 sensory ones. These last run into the hypodermis. 

Linstrow, 1889; Ward, 1892; and Montgomery, 1897, have 
 found structures in the anterior part of the head which may be an 
 eye or possibly a part of the head ganglion. 

May, 1919, recognizes more clearly than Montgomery a ring 
 of nervous tissue in the head region. In Gordius the brain is out- 
 lined at the first as a ring of cells in the hypoderm of the pi-oboscis. 
 It soon separates remaining connected only at the anterior end and 
 ventral side. At first it consists of a few lai-ge cells which surround 
 the larval muscles. These large cells remain in this position while 
 the rest of the brain develops in front. The ventral cord arises as 
 a thickening of the hypoderm, but later separates from it. The cells 
 that make up the nerve cord at first appear as two rows of nuclei 
 on the ventral side of the larva. The larger cells seem to be bipolar, 
 giving off one fiber to the longitudinal tract and one to the dorsal 
 border of the cord. 

The brain of Paragordius develops later than that of Gordius. 
 In the first genus the cells of the lamella are located in the ventral 
 cord while in Gordius it consists of a series of cells. According to 
 May the mass of cells which Montgomery calls retina is the larger 
 part of the cephalic ganglion. 

The reactions of gordioid worms is slow and of a primitive 
 nature. The grasping reaction of the male when in contact with the 
 female is the most definite. If a specimen is at rest it usually re- 
 quires several successive stimuli to cause even a slight movement of 
 the body. There seems to be no distinct response to light. 

ACANTHOCEPHALIA. In this group the nervous system is found 
 to be a single ganglion of large cells located on the surface of the 
 proboscis near its base and two small ganglia in the male which 
 supply the reproductive organs. The larger cephalic center gives 
 off nerves to the proboscis in a cephalic direction and through the 
 lateral retractor muscles on each side caudally strands run out to 
 supply the body-wall. There are no sense organs known. 

Chaetognatha. In Sagitta the nervous system consists of a 
 cerebral ganglion in which eyes are situated. A large ventral gang- 
 lion is situated about one-third or one-half of the way down the 
 body. Oesophageal conectives join these two chief ganglia. Fibers 
 run from the head ganglion to the jaws and sense organs of the head 
 region and two other small ganglia have been de.scribed near the
