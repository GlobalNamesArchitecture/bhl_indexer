A Note on a Local Member of the 
 Family Psychodidae Dip 

Ella Gemmell 

A number of specimens were collected about a drain in a house in Claremont. 
 As they had not been seen here before and as there was no known standing water 
 near, it was a question as to where they had passed their earlier stages. All the 
 specimens were collected in or near the outlet to the small sink. Afterwards it was 

found that the cesspool was nearly filled and a new one had to be made, after this 
 the flies disappeared until once again when the cesspool was filled the flies appeared 
 in the house. 

These specimens were determined to be Psychoda c'lnerea Bks. this being the 
 synonym for P. pacifica as described by Kincaid. The specimens agree in most all 
 parts to Kincaid's description. The specimens were 2 mm. in length. The figure is 
 from a male.
